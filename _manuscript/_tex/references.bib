Digital platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and others are deeply embedded in the daily lives of millions of people around the world, shaping how people engage with others as kin, as citizens, and as consumers. Moving away from Anglo-American and strictly national frameworks, the essays in this book explore the intersections of local, national, regional, and global forces that shape contemporary digital culture(s) in regions like South Asia: the rise of digital and mobile media technologies, the ongoing transformation of established media industries, and emergent forms of digital media practice and use that are reconfiguring sociocultural, political, and economic terrains across the Indian subcontinent. From massive state-driven digital identity projects and YouTube censorship to Tinder and dating culture, from Twitter and primetime},

  title = {Impossible and Inevitable: {{Reconstructing}} the Critique of Business Ethics},
  author = {Meijer, Kim},
  year = {2023},
  month = dec,
  abstract = {Business ethics is a booming subject. Most universities and business schools offer business ethics courses, and many larger businesses have an ethics program in place. Nevertheless, business ethics has a troubled history. The field has been criticized as shallow, simple, and, worst of all, hypocritical. Why, then, is business ethics met with such criticism? Is there something amiss with business ethics in particular, or do other fields of applied ethics face the same criticism? This study set out to address these questions by analyzing the academic critique of business ethics. This examination helps us to develop a better understanding of business ethics itself; that is, of the attempt to apply ethics to business settings. The study starts with a reflection on the early development of business ethics as a `practical' approach to ethics that aimed to appeal strongly to the business world. I show that this development made the field vulnerable to criticism. I then employ a literature review to reconstruct the academic critique of business ethics and to highlight five of its `central problems.' These problems mostly revolve around an alleged misunderstanding of ethics in business ethics. There are critics who frame these problems as specific for business ethics; as if these problems occur in business ethics only. In so doing, business ethics appears to be depicted as the `black sheep' of applied ethics. I, however, hypothesize these problems are related to ethics in general. A problem of ethics in general can be related to each attempt to apply ethics and, therefore, to all fields of applied ethics.Two methods are used to support this hypothesis. A comparative analysis of the critique of business ethics and the critique of bioethics shows that similar problems are related to the latter field. Following this, a hermeneutical study of the philosophical views of Emmanuel Levinas (on the `trauma' of ethics) and Simone de Beauvoir (on the `ambiguity' of ethics) shows that these are indeed problems of ethics in general. Therefore, I conclude these critics are largely mistaken to frame these problems as specific for business ethics and, thus, to depict this field as the `black sheep' of applied ethics. And yet, these critics are not mistaken for bringing these problems to our attention; and for arguing that business ethicists should take these problems seriously. I conclude that it is impossible to resolve these problems but, at the same time, inevitable for fields of applied ethics -- such as business ethics -- to develop approaches to them. Several conditions for approaching these problems are sketched in the epilogue to the study. -De bedrijfsethiek heeft twee gezichten. Aan de ene kant is het een zeer succesvol veld. De meeste universiteiten en hogescholen bieden cursussen bedrijfsethiek aan en vrijwel alle grotere bedrijven hebben een ethiekprogramma (e.g., ethische code of ethiek trainingen). De bedrijfsethiek heeft echter ook een andere kant. Al sinds de oprichting wordt het veld bestookt met felle en fundamentele kritiek. Volgens sommige critici is de moderne bedrijfsethiek niet alleen oppervlakkig en simpel; het is ook een uitermate hypocriet veld. Hoe komt het dat de bedrijfsethiek zo kwetsbaar is voor kritiek? En is deze kritiek alleen van toepassing op bedrijfsethiek, of hebben andere velden van toegepaste ethiek te maken met dezelfde kritiek? Om deze vragen te beantwoorden start ik met een reconstructie van de wetenschappelijke kritiek op de bedrijfsethiek. Ik laat zien dat er ten minste vijf centrale problemen met de bedrijfsethiek zijn. Het gros van deze problemen draait om de notie dat de moderne bedrijfsethiek niet begrijpt waar ethiek over gaat. Er is echter iets merkwaardigs aan deze kritiek; enkele prominente critici presenteren deze problemen alsof ze specifiek zijn voor bedrijfsethiek; alsof deze problemen zich alleen voordoen in dit veld. Hiermee wordt de bedrijfsethiek als het `zwarte schaap' van de toegepaste ethiek neergezet. Ik plaats deze manier van presenteren tussen haakjes en stel dat de problemen van de bedrijfsethiek lijken op problemen van de ethiek in het algemeen. Dit type problemen kan zich voordoen in iedere poging om ethiek toe te passen, en daarmee dus in ieder veld van toegepaste ethiek. Ik gebruik twee methodes om deze hypothese te onderzoeken. Een vergelijkende analyse tussen kritieken op bedrijfsethiek en bio-ethiek laat zien dat de vermeende problemen van de bedrijfsethiek zich in beide velden voordoen. En een hermeneutische studie van argumenten in het werk van Emmanuel Levinas (over ethiek en `trauma') en Simone de Beauvoir (over ethiek en `ambigu{\"i}teit') toont dat we hier inderdaad te maken hebben met problemen van de ethiek in het algemeen. In tegenstelling tot het beeld dat enkele critici ons voorhouden lijkt de bedrijfsethiek dus niet het `zwarte schaap' van de toegepaste ethiek te zijn. Deze critici hebben echter wel gelijk wanneer zij stellen dat deze problemen zich voordoen in dit veld en dat bedrijfsethici de implicaties van deze problemen moeten onderkennen. Ik concludeer dat het onmogelijk is om deze problemen met ethiek op te lossen maar dat het tegelijkertijd onvermijdelijk is voor velden van toegepaste ethiek om tot een goede benadering van deze problemen te komen. Enkele condities voor een dergelijke benadering worden geschetst in de epiloog.},

  abstract = {This text was prepared for presentation in Nagoya, Japan, in 2010. Its aim was to explore a dialogue with Asians toward a cosmopolitan sociology. Beginning from the idea of entangled modernities which threaten their own foundations, Ulrich Beck advocated a complete conceptual innovation of sociology in order to better comprehend the fundamental fragility and mutability of societal dynamics shaped by the globalization of capital and risks today. More specifically, he proposed a cosmopolitan turn of sociology: first, by criticizing methodological nationalism; second, by introducing the concept of cosmopolitization; third, by re-mapping social inequalities; fourth, by discussing risk society in the context of East Asian development; and fifth and finally, by proposing a cosmopolitan vision. Along this line, Beck attempted an overview of the researches done on second modern transformation in East Asia and suggested that an active dialogue may be possible when Asians begin to see the West from their perspectives rather than being caught in the Euro-centric and West-hegemonic presuppositions.},

As developing countries become new terrain for the expansion of US Big Tech and develop their own digital economies, international policy discourses urge the adoption of data governance as self-evidently `good policy' moving into existing regulatory vacuums. However, like any valuable resource, the competition to govern personal data is subject to existing power relations, political interests, institutional pathways and ideologies. With evidence from Indonesia, this article shows how the governance of personal data in the digital economy is influenced by international and national commercial interests, and instrumentalised by domestic state and political elite. In doing so, it adapts the North American`information-security complex'for developing countries with their post-colonial economies, self-interested oligarchic elites and hybrid state-commercial data firms. The significance of this approach lies in its realistic understanding of the challenges and opportunities for supporting data governance reform around the world.},

It highlights a shift in the attitudes of enforcers away from the economic-analysis-informed Chicago and post-Chicago schools of antitrust thought, which are informed by economic analysis, towards New Brandeisian thinking, which emphasizes structural concerns and broader consumer welfare. However, it has yet to catch on in courtrooms. By contrasting the US's antitrust strategy with those of the European Union and China, we argue that antitrust enforcement may hinder economic and technological competitiveness in the short term, but may have long-term benefits. Regarding global digital sovereignty, the US increasing enforcement likely would not impact its global competitiveness, as it still presents a more favorable regulatory environment than the EU, and targeted economic measures prevent Chinese companies from being competitive in the US. New legislation may help address the complexities of modern digital markets so that the US can maintain its competitive edge in technology while enhancing consumer welfare.},

This article traces this quiet expansion by using an innovative virtual private network (VPN)-based method and by calling for an analytical focus on the landscape of the digital civil society in Africa. Specifically, I outline two key, interrelated phenomena: (1) Facebook?s evolving strategy, including a greater engagement with civil society organizations and (2) the focus of digital rights activists in Africa on issues like Internet shutdowns, government surveillance, and the lack of data privacy frameworks. In the process, I illuminate broader trends in the digital industry including tech corporations? growing investments in mobile social media, network infrastructures, and in civil society; the use of disadvantaged populations and unregulated territories for digital experiments and data extraction; and the mounting recognition of Facebook?s political role, both within and outside the corporation.},

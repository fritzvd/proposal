    "Digital connectivity is a must for advancing economic growth and personal development. Digital privacy however is something we often neglect, or is a luxury to consider \\[@papacharissiPrivacyLuxuryCommodity2010\\], when most communication platforms require a privacy sacrifice to partake in its benefits for free. Low digital literacy in combination with high connectivity can be dangerous. Multiple studies have seen a combination of reasons why some people are more prone to be a victim of fraud, one of which is low digital literacy \\[@liDoesDigitalLiteracy2024\\]. Most people are not aware that all the small bits and pieces we offer to social platforms can be used by big tech companies to put together a “Gestalt” of a user \\[@puaschunder2018dignity\\]. Or put more simply, to understand what constitutes and drives an individual online.\\$\\$"

    "Beyond privacy concerns, GenAI makes it a lot easier to cause harm by creating misinformation at the speed of light, AI generated faces cannot be discerned from real faces\\[@millerAIHyperrealismWhy2023; @nightingaleAIsynthesizedFacesAre2022\\], making people susceptible to scams and other forms of cybercrime \\[@reidRisksGenerativeArtificial2024; @shoaibDeepfakesMisinformationDisinformation2023\\].\n",

    "GenAI literacy research has focused on the increased digital divide \\[@hendawy2024intensified\\], learning how to succesfully create prompts \\[@kee2024generative\\], how students or teachers can use GenAI in learning \\[@meli2024empowering; @adarkwah2025genai\\] and lower barriers to learning \\[@roeGenAIDigitalPlastic2025\\]. The importance of increasing digital literacy in this respect is recognized \\[@shoaibDeepfakesMisinformationDisinformation2023\\], and proposes mixed models, like human-machine collaboration for detecting deep-fakes \\[@guptaEyesKnowIt2020\\].\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  What constitutes low digital literacy and how does privacy and AI have their own blind spots?\n",
    "2.  What are ways to increase digital literacy concerning privacy?\n",
    "3.  How can people be instructed recognize “AI smells”?"

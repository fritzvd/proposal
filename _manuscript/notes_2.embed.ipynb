    "As humans in a digital society we are living lives that are entwined with technology that exchanges data. We need to exchange data to track our businesses, for our communications with friends and family, to come ahead in our educational system, to pay our taxes etcetera, etcetera. We sacrifice our privacy to get access to free applications or to benefit our security \\[@mckinnon2014sacrificing\\], or move along faster in a health system \\[\\], or even to register for asylum \\[@lodinovaApplicationBiometricsMeans2016\\]. These applications typically track our internet behaviour \\[@makhortykhTrackNotTrack2022;@razaghpanahAppsTrackersPrivacy2018\\]. This tracking of biometric, location and social data is not without danger, this data is also used for the creation of economic value and has lead to something more than just a phenomenon of capitalism; it’s a manifestation of colonialism \\[@couldry2019data\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "With new developments in AI this becomes more prevalent as data and AI “entrench power assymetries and engender new forms of structural violence and new inequities between the Global South and North” \\[@madianou2024technocolonialism\\]. There is little to no protection or privacy for private consumers unless government regulation explicitly makes it so, like the GDPR program \\[@arora2019general\\]. Much of Global South legislation is lagging behind or has met with challenges in enforcing the laws set in place \\[@prinslooDataPrivacyAfrican2022\\].\n",

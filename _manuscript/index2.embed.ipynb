    "New ways to use Generative Artifical Intelligence (genAI) for increasing productivity \\[\\], criminal behaviour \\[@ferraraGenAIHumanityNefarious2024\\], berievement \\[@suRightRealityHuman2025\\] are coming at us fast. GenAI is rapidly reshaping how we work \\[@joshi2025transformative\\], how we sleep \\[\\], and how learn \\[@perifanouCollaborativeUsesGenAI2025\\]. Life after AI comes at a tremendous physical cost for our planet \\[@crawford2021atlas\\]. The physical extraction of metals for chips, the power consumption to drive the machines and then again for cooling is outgrowing the planned construction of the power grid at a breakneck speed \\[@linExplodingAIPower2024\\].\n",

    "Digital connectivity is a must for advancing economic growth and personal development. Digital privacy however is something we often neglect, or is a luxury to consider ([Papacharissi 2010](#ref-papacharissiPrivacyLuxuryCommodity2010)), when most communication platforms require a privacy sacrifice to partake in its benefits for free. Low digital literacy in combination with high connectivity can be dangerous. Multiple studies have seen a combination of reasons why some people are more prone to be a victim of fraud, one of which is low digital literacy ([Li, Li, and Du 2024](#ref-liDoesDigitalLiteracy2024)). Most people are not aware that all the small bits and pieces we offer to social platforms can be used by big tech companies to put together a “Gestalt” of a user ([Puaschunder 2018](#ref-puaschunder2018dignity)). Or put more simply, to understand what constitutes and drives an individual online.\\$\\$"

    "GenAI literacy research has focused on the increased digital divide ([Hendawy 2024](#ref-hendawy2024intensified)), learning how to succesfully create prompts ([Kee, Kuys, and King 2024](#ref-kee2024generative)), how students or teachers can use GenAI in learning ([Meli, Taouki, and Pantazatos 2024](#ref-meli2024empowering); [Adarkwah 2025](#ref-adarkwah2025genai)) and lower barriers to learning ([Roe, Furze, and Perkins 2025](#ref-roeGenAIDigitalPlastic2025)). The importance of increasing digital literacy in this respect is recognized ([Shoaib et al. 2023](#ref-shoaibDeepfakesMisinformationDisinformation2023)), and proposes mixed models, like human-machine collaboration for detecting deep-fakes ([Gupta et al. 2020](#ref-guptaEyesKnowIt2020)).\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  What constitutes low digital literacy and how does privacy and AI have their own blind spots?\n",
    "2.  What are ways to increase digital literacy concerning privacy?\n",
    "3.  How can people be instructed recognize “AI smells”?\n",

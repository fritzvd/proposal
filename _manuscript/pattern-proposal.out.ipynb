    "With the rise of digitization and the data is produces, the question of ownership of data becomes a contested issue for agents such as Indigenous people, consumers and countries([Hummel et al. 2021](#ref-hummel2021data)). If the ownership is not clear and personal data cannot always be obtained ([Herrmann and Lindemann 2016](#ref-herrmannObtainingPersonalData2016)) it should be clear we should not only look to data governance but also to privacy literacy ([Koltay 2016](#ref-koltay2016data)). According to Rotman ([n.d.](#ref-rotmanAreYouLooking)) for users to consciously decide what happens with their information they should go from *understanding, recognizing, realizing, evaluating* to *deciding*. Much of privacy literacy literature has used ethnocentric Western-based ideas of governance and regulation that do not take into account the multi-varied ways privacy can be perceived in the Majority World([Arora 2019](#ref-arora2019general)).\n",

    "Some Big Tech parties have decided to bring a limited version of the internet to the Majority World in the last decade “Introducing Project Loon: <span class=\"nocase\">Balloon-powered Internet</span> Access” ([2013](#ref-IntroducingProjectLoon2013)).\n",

    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding what happens with your data is difficult and ambigiuous in any context ([Bartsch and Dienlin 2016](#ref-bartschControlYourFacebook2016)), intuitively this would be even more so where internet is free. Companies like Meta profit from tracking users online ([Wernerfelt et al. 2025](#ref-wernerfeltEstimatingValueOffsite2025)). Where the quality or the inner workings are being assessed Sen et al. ([2017](#ref-senWalledGardenDeconstructing2017)) results are mixed. On the other hand zero-rated services have significantly contributed to access to information and appointments for Maternal Health or free messaging for HIV/AIDS medical appointments ([Layton and Elaluf-Calderwood 2016](#ref-layton2016free)). Other critiques of “zero-rating” are issues of net-neutrality and gatekeeping ([Galpaya, n.d.](#ref-galpayaZeroratingEmergingEconomies)).\n",

    "\n",
    "With the rise of digitization and the data it produces, the question of ownership of data becomes a contested issue for agents such as Indigenous people, consumers and countries ([Hummel et al. 2021](#ref-hummel2021data)). If the ownership is not clear and personal data cannot always be obtained ([Herrmann and Lindemann 2016](#ref-herrmannObtainingPersonalData2016)) it should be clear we should not only look to data governance or ownership but also to defending this data in the light of privacy norms. However, digital privacy in much of Africa is subject to local and regional legislation ([Prinsloo and Kaliisa 2022](#ref-prinslooDataPrivacyAfrican2022)), but its main challenge lies in enforcement of this legislation ([Abdulrauf 2021](#ref-Abdulrauf04052021)). We should therefore not only rely on legislation, but also work towards higher privacy literacy ([Koltay 2016](#ref-koltay2016data)).\n",

    "Digital privacy is not a binary or singular thing, and giving our personal information to gain access to a platform or a service can be useful. However people largely underestimate the small bits of information we give to big tech and how the sum of that can still offer a persona or Gestalt ([Puaschunder 2018](#ref-puaschunder2018dignity)) with useful insights."

    "\n",
    "Understanding what happens with your data is difficult and ambigiuous in any context ([Bartsch and Dienlin 2016](#ref-bartschControlYourFacebook2016)). Regulation and enforcement often falls behind. And some regulation interventions simply fail, like the “cookie wall”-solution ([Leenes and Kosta 2015](#ref-leenes2015taming)).

    "## Research questions\n",

    "### Main question\n",
    "\n",
    "How can people in the Majority World benefit from being “connected” without sacrificing their privacy?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is permissable in bridging the digital divide? To what extent is big tech allowed to\n",

    "**(Possibly this can be more specified towards a Case Study in rural South Africa, or Botswana?)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub-questions\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What initiatives stand out in ameliorating the digital divide?\n",
    "-   In what way are people aware of the predicament of sharing personal information?\n",
    "-   What is the benefit of participating in the digital “online world”?\n",
    "-   What legislation is in place to ensure digital privacy at a national and regional level?\n",
    "-   What conflicts between legislation and ethics arise concerning privacy?\n",

    "## Conceptual Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Nissenbaum ([2004](#ref-nissenbaum2004privacy)) proposes the idea of “Contextual Integrity” for privacy. Which instead of focusing on specifics of data outlines “information flows”, of which the norms are subject to the context in which that data flows. With this notion of Contextual Integrity, we can easily establish the divulging of the same type of personal information can be completely permissable in one context and inappropriate in the other. For example sharing my postal address to purchase a product is permissable, whereas sharing my postal address with my students so they can hand in their papers personally, feels like crossing a boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of “Contextual Integrity” has been used in a number of studies to deal with personal information flows."

    "A study by Prinsloo and Kaliisa ([2022](#ref-prinslooDataPrivacyAfrican2022)) has been held to asses specific sub-topics such as student data privacy researching regulatory frameworks on the African content. The angle here to assess Higher Education Institutes (HEI’s) is helpful as it is a very concrete example and produces very clear results. However HEI’s are also quite an exclusive segment of society that cannot be used to draw broader conclusions. Another study uses a survey in an impressive array of countries but has quite a low sample size, primarily in the generation we call millenials, which might be the most digital and privacy literate ([Agbozo, Alhassan, and Spassov 2018](#ref-agbozo2018personal)).\n",

    "This study should be different from both previous efforts by both its scope and localization.\n",

    "As humans in a digital society we are living lives that are entwined with technology that exchanges data. We need to exchange data to track our businesses, for our communications with friends and family, to come ahead in our educational system, to pay our taxes etcetera, etcetera. We sacrifice our privacy to get access to free applications or to benefit our security ([McKinnon 2014](#ref-mckinnon2014sacrificing)), or move along faster in a health system \\[\\], or even to register for asylum ([Lodinová 2016](#ref-lodinovaApplicationBiometricsMeans2016)). These applications typically track our internet behaviour ([Makhortykh et al. 2022](#ref-makhortykhTrackNotTrack2022); [Razaghpanah et al. 2018](#ref-razaghpanahAppsTrackersPrivacy2018)). This tracking of biometric, location and social data is not without danger, this data is also used for the creation of economic value and has lead to something more than just a phenomenon of capitalism; it’s a manifestation of colonialism ([**couldry2019data?**](#ref-couldry2019data)).\n",
    "\n",
    "With new developments in AI this becomes more prevalent as data and AI “entrench power assymetries and engender new forms of structural violence and new inequities between the Global South and North” ([Madianou 2024](#ref-madianou2024technocolonialism)). There is little to no protection or privacy for private consumers unless government regulation explicitly makes it so, like the GDPR program ([Arora 2019](#ref-arora2019general)). Much of Global South legislation is lagging behind or has met with challenges in enforcing the laws set in place ([Prinsloo and Kaliisa 2022](#ref-prinslooDataPrivacyAfrican2022)).\n",

    "Research theme AI and National Diffusion Differences Summary of the Project (99/100 words) This project examines how generative AI is reshaping humanitarian volunteering, a global workforce of 970 million often overlooked in digital transformation agendas. Centering on Red Cross volunteers in Sri Lanka, Kenya, and the Netherlands, it analyzes how adoption varies across contexts and the cultural and organizational factors that enable or hinder diffusion. Positioning volunteering as a pathway to workforce development, it explores how GenAI can enhance training, coordination, and crisis readiness while reducing inequities. Using comparative digital ethnography and action research, findings will provide policymakers, civic organizations, and global partners actionable strategies to embed inclusive AI in humanitarian ecosystems.\n",

    "With the rise of digitization and the data it produces, the question of ownership of data becomes a contested issue for agents such as Indigenous people, consumers and countries \\[@hummel2021data\\]. If the ownership is not clear and personal data cannot always be obtained \\[@herrmannObtainingPersonalData2016\\] it should be clear we should not only look to data governance or ownership but also to defending this data in the light of privacy norms. However, digital privacy in much of Africa is subject to local and regional legislation \\[@prinslooDataPrivacyAfrican2022\\], but its main challenge lies in enforcement of this legislation \\[@Abdulrauf04052021\\]. We should therefore not only rely on legislation, but also work towards higher privacy literacy \\[@koltay2016data\\].\n",

    "Digital privacy is not a binary or singular thing, and giving our personal information to gain access to a platform or a service can be useful. However people largely underestimate the small bits of information we give to big tech and how the sum of that can still offer a persona or Gestalt \\[@puaschunder2018dignity\\] with useful insights."

    "-   What initiatives stand out in ameliorating the digital divide?\n",
    "-   In what way are people aware of the predicament of sharing personal information?\n",
    "-   What is the benefit of participating in the digital “online world”?\n",
    "-   What legislation is in place to ensure digital privacy at a national and regional level?\n",

    "## Conceptual Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "@nissenbaum2004privacy proposes the idea of “Contextual Integrity” for privacy. Which instead of focusing on specifics of data outlines “information flows”, of which the norms are subject to the context in which that data flows. With this notion of Contextual Integrity, we can easily establish the divulging of the same type of personal information can be completely permissable in one context and inappropriate in the other. For example sharing my postal address to purchase a product is permissable, whereas sharing my postal address with my students so they can hand in their papers personally, feels like crossing a boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of “Contextual Integrity” has been used in a number of studies to deal with personal information flows."

    "A study by @prinslooDataPrivacyAfrican2022 has been held to asses specific sub-topics such as student data privacy researching regulatory frameworks on the African content. The angle here to assess Higher Education Institutes (HEI’s) is helpful as it is a very concrete example and produces very clear results. However HEI’s are also quite an exclusive segment of society that cannot be used to draw broader conclusions. Another study uses a survey in an impressive array of countries but has quite a low sample size, primarily in the generation we call millenials, which might be the most digital and privacy literate \\[@agbozo2018personal\\].\n",

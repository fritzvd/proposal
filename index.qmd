## Introduction

For most people exchanging data, even personal data has become essential to their day to day life. We exchange messages, store data about our health, and use apps where the exchange of our coordinates on this earth are accurate up to about 1-2 meters. As we do not pay for these services and these companies thrive on the use of our data and tracking our every move, serious concerns are being raised about the risks on an individual and societal level [@rathenauinstituutPrijsVanGratis2025]. From a government perspective biometric data is collected for refugees registering to seek asylum [@farraj2010refugees] and we have seen a surge in digital health passes during and after COVID-19 [@mithani2022scoping]. Haiti saw one of the most effective participation in crowdsourced mapping through Ushahidi [@norheim2010crowdsourcing]. Some of these efforts are well intended and do a lot of good [@soden2014crowdsourced @worldhealthorganisationGlobalDigitalHealth], but this tracking of biometric and social data is also used for the creation of economic value and has lead to something more than just a phenomenon of capitalism; it's a manifestation of colonialism [@couldry2019data]. With new developments in AI this becomes more prevalent as data and AI "entrench power assymetries and engender new forms of structural violence and new inequities between the global South and North" [@madianou2024technocolonialism]. The quest for more users and ever larger expansion has led Big Tech (e.g. Google, Meta) to look for areas where internet usage is not as widely spread as it is in "the West" and offer programs providing a limited set of Internet services (e.g. Project Loon [@IntroducingProjectLoon2013] and Free Basics [@MetaConnectivity]). There is little to no protection or privacy for private consumers unless government regulation explicitly makes it so, like the GDPR program [@arora2019general].

<!-- Third parties are becoming an integral part of government policy to deal with the process of data collection and analysis [@johnson2023owns]. -->

> Most countries outside the West have lax or no privacy laws (Taylor, Floridi, and van der Sloot 2016). Brazil passed its first privacy laws in 2014, while India passed some in 2017. - [@arora2019general]

## Research Questions

In what way can power assymetries between the majority world and the minority world be limited by effective legislation towards protecting personal data of citizens?

How can privacy literacy be increased that respects a cultural tradition without using a Eurocentric view of individual privacy but including a collective privacy?


## Methodology

- Qualitative investigation of policy, laws in different countries
- Questionnaire on usage of internet and awareness of privacy concerns..

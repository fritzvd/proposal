## Introduction

Digital connectivity is a must for advancing economic growth and personal development, whether we like it or not. Digital privacy however is something we often neglect, or is a luxury to consider [@papacharissiPrivacyLuxuryCommodity2010], when most communication platforms require a privacy sacrifice to partake in its benefits for free.
Low digital literacy in combination with high connectivity can be dangerous. Multiple studies have seen a combination of reasons why some people are more prone to be a victim of fraud, one of which is low digital literacy [@liDoesDigitalLiteracy2024]. Most people are not aware that all the small bits and pieces we offer to social platforms can be used by big tech companies to put together a "Gestalt" of a user [@puaschunder2018dignity]. Or put more simply, to understand what constitutes and drives an individual online.

Big tech companies are trying to get more people online and part of their platforms by offering zero-rated services [@MetaConnectivity]. The benefits of LLM's and GenAI are largely available for free where users can offer details about private matters or upload work-related documents without clearly stating what is being done with their data.

Beyond privacy concerns, GenAI makes it a lot easier to cause harm by creating misinformation at the speed of light, AI generated faces cannot be discerned from real faces[@millerAIHyperrealismWhy2023; @nightingaleAIsynthesizedFacesAre2022], making people susceptible to scams and other forms of cybercrime [@reidRisksGenerativeArtificial2024; @shoaibDeepfakesMisinformationDisinformation2023].

How then do people in low digital literacy environments educate themselves to guard themselves against these forces?

## Conceptual Framework

## Scientific debate

GenAI literacy research has focused on the increased digital divide [@hendawy2024intensified], learning how to succesfully create prompts [@kee2024generative], how students or teachers can use GenAI in learning [@meli2024empowering; @adarkwah2025genai] and lower barriers to learning [@roeGenAIDigitalPlastic2025]. The importance of increasing digital literacy in this respect is recognized [@shoaibDeepfakesMisinformationDisinformation2023], and proposes mixed models, like human-machine collaboration for detecting deep-fakes [@guptaEyesKnowIt2020].

However, up to now a framework, model or test method of how to approach the increasing of literacy in this regard is lacking.

## Research Question

1. How do people in low digital literacy environments, overcome vectors that are harmful?

### Sub-questions

1. What constitutes low digital literacy and how does privacy and AI have their own blind spots?
2. What are ways to increase digital literacy concerning privacy?
3. How can people be instructed recognize "AI smells"?

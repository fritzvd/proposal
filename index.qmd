## Problem

AI developments and specifically GenAI with the likes of ChatGPT have skyrocketed demand for land, power and natural resources as data centers need to expand. Digital solutions have impact in physical realities. The promise of technology is always that x will solve y in numerous cases. Nanotechnology, blockchain, big data analysis all claim the same, but we're increasingly living in a world with bigger divides between the poorest and the richest.

## Gap

Much research has been done on using waste heat [@tereniusMaterialSocialView2023], the impact on the environment the data centers themselves are having [], its construction phase [@nunez-moralesTrueEnvironmentalCost2025] and water use [@hoganDataFlowsWater2015], but the societal influence of reshaping of physical space is unknown. The magnitude of influence is often counterposed with the inevitable excellence this AI will propel us in. Is this justified?

## Hook

In this research I use the hypothesis that the way the digital advances influence physical space through the construction and maintenance of data centers and the resources it requires are bound to have a significant influence in lived realities where these data centers are being built. -->

## Introduction

Generative Artifical Intelligence (genAI), a specific form of Artifical Intelligence harnessing the power of Large Language Models to _generate_ new output based on vast and widely generalized data sources, is rapidly transforming our lives. Ranging from reshaping how we work [@joshi2025transformative] and how we learn [@perifanouCollaborativeUsesGenAI2025], to changing criminal behaviour [@ferraraGenAIHumanityNefarious2024] and even influencing democratization [@cupacDemocratizationAgeArtificial2024].

Life in the age of genAI however, comes at a tremendous physical cost for our planet [@crawford2021atlas]. The physical extraction of metals for chips to enable the machines to run the models [], the power consumption to drive the machines and then again for cooling is outgrowing the planned construction of the power grid at a breakneck speed [@linExplodingAIPower2024], outpacing policy and lawmakers.

As with all transformative technologies there is firstly a real oppurtunity, in the increased productivity and the access to tools . Secondly a real threat, in the form of misinformation, criminal activity, [@ferraraGenAIHumanityNefarious2024] and the undermining of autonomy [@cupacDemocratizationAgeArtificial2024]. Thirdly a challenge for the use of resources and electricity that needs new solutions at scale.

Technology is not a neutral phenomenon with inherently positive outcomes.

### Gap

We do not know how AI will reshape the future of our human development, but there are some guesses we can make and historical lessons we can take into account. In all the major jumps in technological advancement that brought about societal change: steam engine, electricity, communications, digital communication and now the more broadly available statistical models that "converse" with us through chat like ChatGPT, we have seen that regulation and policy fueled by ideology has been the driver for the direction this advancement would take us [@johnsonPowerProgressOur2023 pp. 57].

Much of the research regarding AI has been focussing on improving models [], effects for legislation [], impact on education [], but not increasing agency and freedom what the UNDP describes as indicative of improving human development [@undpHumanDevelopmentReport2025].

What is lacking then from scientific discourse is a systematic analysis of the factors that have been able to increase agency and in different areas like education, the work place, and at home.

<!-- In 1965 @theobaldFreeMenFree1965 already reacted to a scare for the changes automation would bring -->

### Hook

The ideological belief that when the models become better our planet will become better are baseless and naive. We need to figure out ways where this powerful technology can become a force with guidance to a better world.

## Research Questions

- How do we harness the accelerated changes GenAI is bringing to foster empowerment, freedom and increased human agency as opposed to oppression and machine driven decision-making?

## Sub questions

- What challenges arise when deploying GenAI at world scale?
- What policies and laws have been instrumental in steering technologically driven societal transformation in the past and where has it failed?
- What opportunities are still open?

## Opbouw

- Toename van tools en mogelijkheden
- Toename van verzamelde gegevens
- Ogenschijnlijke voordelen
- Push van Big Tech om dit te verwezenlijken
- "Geweld" met verzamelen van biometrische gegevens
- In de context van huminataire interventies wordt er gekeken naar de mogelijke voordelen van het gebruik van genAI
- Mogelijke gevaren van gebruik van genAI in huminataire interventies
- Wat zijn de werkzaamheden van die vrijwilligers?
- Wat is het digitale geletterdheidsniveau van vrijwilligers?
- Hoe kunnen deze vrijwilligers gebruik van maken van genAI tools
- Welke gevaren komen daarbij kijken?
- Wat voor type data hanteren ze en welke risico's lopen huminataire slachtoffers door het vrijgeven van informatie in "black-boxes"

- Werken met persooonlijke gegevens en AI..

- Bredere vraag: wat is nodig om te vragen en wat is moreel correct?
- De machtspositie van humanitaire organisaties, door de afhankelijkheidsrelatie tussen slachtoffer en vrijwilliger
- Welke keuzevrijheid hebben humanitaire slachtoffers?
- Welke belangen hebben humanitaire slachtoffers? 
- Wordt er misbruik gemaakt van de kwetsbaarheid van de slachtoffers?

## Introduction

As humans in a digital society we are living lives that are entwined with technology that exchanges data. We need to exchange data across a myriad of transactions including: to track our businesses, for our communications with friends and family, to come ahead in our educational system, to pay our taxes and many more. We sacrifice our privacy to get access to free applications or to benefit our security [@mckinnon2014sacrificing], or move along faster in a health system [@kernDesigningElectronicPatient2016], or even to register for asylum [@lodinovaApplicationBiometricsMeans2016]. The use of wearables, biometric identification and health monitors have made data flows much more personal, even becoming part of our hormonal cycles and sex life[@gomezortegaDesigningSecondaryUsers2025]. Watches locating children, or apps keeping track of spouses are commonplace, but also form a danger as a "dual-use technology" for malevolent tracking or even surveillance, which itself is a manifestation of inter partner violence [@almansooriGlobalSurveyAndroid2022].

End User License Agreements (EULA's), that require a great deal of surrender of personal information, are signed with a sense apathy and powerlessness [@gomezortegaSurrenderingPowerlesnessGoverning2025; @draperPrivacyResignationApathy2024].

Recent developments have seen generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) being available for the masses with Large Language Models (LLM's) having a much easier interface for non-technical users. Often signified with the moniker: AI or with magical stars (✨) it features in many applications ranging from web search to [@googleGoogleAIMode;@duckduckgoDuckaiDuckDuckGoHelp; @microsoftIntroducingNewBing] personal communication such as Outlook [@ChatCopilotOutlook] or Whatsapp [@metaMetaAIWhatsApp]. genAI is quickly becoming embedded in all sorts of business and applications [@grantham-philipsAIBecomingIngrained2024].
Even more than in applications beforehand users are encouraged to upload documents and provide more context for the LLM to perform better.

As a result of the increased use of genAI, such as LLM's, a great variety of topics have been researched in the last few years. Such as environmental impact [@dingSustainableLLMServing2024; @rillig2023risks], or a comparison of energy consumption of LLM's vs humans [@ren2024reconciling]. On the other hand the need to improve the environmental impact [@jiangPreventingImmenseIncrease2024; @stojkovic2024towards]. GenAI is also described as both closing and / or widening the digital divide [@carterExploringIntersectionDigital2020; @sartoriMindingGapsPublic2023]. In the context of privacy it seems there is more uncertainty.

<!-- The fact that this data is also used for the creation of economic value and has lead to something more than just a phenomenon of capitalism; it's a manifestation of colonialism [@couldry2019data]. -->

<!-- With new developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and more specifically generative AI (genAI) this becomes more prevalent as data and AI "entrench power assymetries and engender new forms of structural violence and new inequities between the Global South and North" [@madianou2024technocolonialism].
With the advent of large language models (LLMs) that are available to a wide audience with consumer-friendly applications such as ChatGPT, Claude, Google AI and so forth, this becomes relevant for a much wider audience. -->
<!-- 
There is little to no protection or privacy for private consumers unless government regulation explicitly makes it so, like the GDPR program [@arora2019general]. Much of Global South legislation is lagging behind or has met with challenges in enforcing the laws set in place [@prinslooDataPrivacyAfrican2022].  -->

## Context

With the rise of digitization and the data it produces, the question of ownership of data becomes a contested issue for agents such as Indigenous people, consumers and countries [@hummel2021data]. If the ownership is not clear and personal data cannot always be obtained [@herrmannObtainingPersonalData2016] it should be clear we should not only look to data governance or ownership but also to defending this data in the light of privacy norms. However, digital privacy in much of Africa is subject to local and regional legislation [@prinslooDataPrivacyAfrican2022], but its main challenge lies in enforcement of this legislation [@Abdulrauf04052021]. We should therefore not only rely on legislation, but also work towards higher privacy literacy [@koltay2016data].

Digital privacy is not a binary or singular thing. The privacy we demand when it comes to sharing our thoughts on personal photos with family, is very different to the privacy we expect when we are at work and working on a document together with colleagues. 

<!-- Not only the level of privacy but also the ease with which people could gain access, should be handled differently. -->
<!-- 
Much of privacy literacy literature has used ethnocentric Western-based ideas of governance and regulation that do not take into account the multi-varied ways privacy can be perceived in the Global South [@arora2019general; @aroraDecolonizingPrivacyStudies2019]. -->


## Problem

Understanding what happens with your data is difficult and ambigiuous in any context [@bartschControlYourFacebook2016]. Regulation and enforcement often falls behind. And some regulation interventions simply fail, like the "cookie wall"-solution [@leenes2015taming]. When companies like Meta profit from tracking users online [@wernerfeltEstimatingValueOffsite2025] and  

## Research questions

### Main question

How can people in the Majority World benefit from being "connected" without sacrificing their privacy?

__(Possibly this can be more specified towards a Case Study in rural South Africa, or Botswana?)__

### Sub-questions

- What initiatives stand out in amelirioating the digital divide?
- In what way are people aware of the predicament of sharing personal information?
- What is the benefit of participating in the digital "online world"?
- What legislation is in place to ensure digital privacy at a national and regional level?
- What conflicts between legislation and ethics arise concerning privacy?
- What are main differences when dealing with privacy in Europe and SSA?

## Conceptual Framework

@nissenbaum2004privacy proposes the idea of "Contextual Integrity" for privacy. Which makes a lot of sense as a way of approaching digital privacy. The main takeaway is that gathering information in and of itself is not wrong per se, but it largely depends on the context and how that information can tie into other information that makes it not conform to our norms, whilst still being in accordance with the law.

## Research methodology

At the moment I'm reading @hanckeIntelligentResearchDesign2023 and sorting through the vast bibliography of  @sovacoolPromotingNoveltyRigor2018 to help sort out the methodology part.

My initial instinct is to do a survey, but I would like to do something a bit different. But not sure how to go about this.

Some other ideas:

Ideas on how to accomplish this:

- A/B Testing -- do survey's on 2 groups
  - one group has received a seminar or dissemination of the information about privacy the other has not
- Do a deeper but not necessarily wider analysis. So perhaps look for a few groups of participants in rural Botswana and a few groups in urban Botswana. Or try to localize it further by looking at interactions wihtin townships.
- Data acquisition might be a problem.. 


## Significance

A study by @prinslooDataPrivacyAfrican2022 has been held to asses specific sub-topics such as student data privacy researching regulatory frameworks on the African content. The angle here to assess Higher Education Institutes (HEI's) is helpful as it is a very concrete example and produces very clear results. However HEI's are also quite an exclusive segment of society that cannot be used to draw broader conclusions.
Another study uses a survey in an impressive array of countries but has quite a low sample size, primarily in the generation we call millenials, which might be the most digital and privacy literate [@agbozo2018personal].

This study should be different from both previous efforts by both its scope and localization.

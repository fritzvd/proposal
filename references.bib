  abstract = {In the last decade, the Global South has emerged as a significant player in the data economy due to their majority user base, and studying its role is crucial to comprehend the future of AI. As societies grapple with the implications of AI on creative life, there is an opportunity to reevaluate the creative contributions of Global South cultures, ensuring they are acknowledged and foregrounded in the evolving landscape of human and machine creativity. This paper calls for reimagining and restructuring creative value with the emergence of AI enabled technologies by broadening who and what counts as creative in this data-driven era. To democratize creativity, a decolonial and indigenous framework of cross-cultural creative value is needed which critically intersects and examines the relations between creative labor, rights, and learning. The study of the Global South's data economies is important not only to harness its potential but also to address the cross-cultural ethics of building Creative AI tools with data from their underrepresented communities. At its core, the creative data justice framework emphasizes the need to challenge the existing power imbalances in global data governance. This paper proposes that fair creative value can be achieved by drawing inspiration from indigenous systems of care as a counterforce to neoliberal values of efficiency and utility. This framework will help scholars, policymakers and designers in their inclusive approaches to creativity in the age of AI.},

As technology companies expand their reach worldwide, the notion of privacy continues to be viewed through an ethnocentric lens. It disproportionately draws from empirical evidence on Western-based, white, and middle-class demographics. We need to break away from the market-driven neoliberal ideology and the Development paradigm long dictating media studies if we are to foster more inclusive privacy policies. This paper offers a set of propositions to de-naturalize and estrange data from demographic generalizations and cultural assumptions, namely, (1) predicting privacy harms through the history of social practice, (2) recalibrating the core-periphery as evolving and moving targets, and (3) de-exoticizing ``natives'' by situating privacy in ludic digital cultures. In essence, decolonizing privacy studies is as much an act of reimagining people and place as it is of dismantling essentialisms that are regurgitated through scholarship.},

  title = {Impossible and Inevitable: {{Reconstructing}} the Critique of Business Ethics},
  author = {Meijer, Kim},
  year = {2023},
  month = dec,
  abstract = {Business ethics is a booming subject. Most universities and business schools offer business ethics courses, and many larger businesses have an ethics program in place. Nevertheless, business ethics has a troubled history. The field has been criticized as shallow, simple, and, worst of all, hypocritical. Why, then, is business ethics met with such criticism? Is there something amiss with business ethics in particular, or do other fields of applied ethics face the same criticism? This study set out to address these questions by analyzing the academic critique of business ethics. This examination helps us to develop a better understanding of business ethics itself; that is, of the attempt to apply ethics to business settings. The study starts with a reflection on the early development of business ethics as a `practical' approach to ethics that aimed to appeal strongly to the business world. I show that this development made the field vulnerable to criticism. I then employ a literature review to reconstruct the academic critique of business ethics and to highlight five of its `central problems.' These problems mostly revolve around an alleged misunderstanding of ethics in business ethics. There are critics who frame these problems as specific for business ethics; as if these problems occur in business ethics only. In so doing, business ethics appears to be depicted as the `black sheep' of applied ethics. I, however, hypothesize these problems are related to ethics in general. A problem of ethics in general can be related to each attempt to apply ethics and, therefore, to all fields of applied ethics.Two methods are used to support this hypothesis. A comparative analysis of the critique of business ethics and the critique of bioethics shows that similar problems are related to the latter field. Following this, a hermeneutical study of the philosophical views of Emmanuel Levinas (on the `trauma' of ethics) and Simone de Beauvoir (on the `ambiguity' of ethics) shows that these are indeed problems of ethics in general. Therefore, I conclude these critics are largely mistaken to frame these problems as specific for business ethics and, thus, to depict this field as the `black sheep' of applied ethics. And yet, these critics are not mistaken for bringing these problems to our attention; and for arguing that business ethicists should take these problems seriously. I conclude that it is impossible to resolve these problems but, at the same time, inevitable for fields of applied ethics -- such as business ethics -- to develop approaches to them. Several conditions for approaching these problems are sketched in the epilogue to the study. -De bedrijfsethiek heeft twee gezichten. Aan de ene kant is het een zeer succesvol veld. De meeste universiteiten en hogescholen bieden cursussen bedrijfsethiek aan en vrijwel alle grotere bedrijven hebben een ethiekprogramma (e.g., ethische code of ethiek trainingen). De bedrijfsethiek heeft echter ook een andere kant. Al sinds de oprichting wordt het veld bestookt met felle en fundamentele kritiek. Volgens sommige critici is de moderne bedrijfsethiek niet alleen oppervlakkig en simpel; het is ook een uitermate hypocriet veld. Hoe komt het dat de bedrijfsethiek zo kwetsbaar is voor kritiek? En is deze kritiek alleen van toepassing op bedrijfsethiek, of hebben andere velden van toegepaste ethiek te maken met dezelfde kritiek? Om deze vragen te beantwoorden start ik met een reconstructie van de wetenschappelijke kritiek op de bedrijfsethiek. Ik laat zien dat er ten minste vijf centrale problemen met de bedrijfsethiek zijn. Het gros van deze problemen draait om de notie dat de moderne bedrijfsethiek niet begrijpt waar ethiek over gaat. Er is echter iets merkwaardigs aan deze kritiek; enkele prominente critici presenteren deze problemen alsof ze specifiek zijn voor bedrijfsethiek; alsof deze problemen zich alleen voordoen in dit veld. Hiermee wordt de bedrijfsethiek als het `zwarte schaap' van de toegepaste ethiek neergezet. Ik plaats deze manier van presenteren tussen haakjes en stel dat de problemen van de bedrijfsethiek lijken op problemen van de ethiek in het algemeen. Dit type problemen kan zich voordoen in iedere poging om ethiek toe te passen, en daarmee dus in ieder veld van toegepaste ethiek. Ik gebruik twee methodes om deze hypothese te onderzoeken. Een vergelijkende analyse tussen kritieken op bedrijfsethiek en bio-ethiek laat zien dat de vermeende problemen van de bedrijfsethiek zich in beide velden voordoen. En een hermeneutische studie van argumenten in het werk van Emmanuel Levinas (over ethiek en `trauma') en Simone de Beauvoir (over ethiek en `ambigu{\"i}teit') toont dat we hier inderdaad te maken hebben met problemen van de ethiek in het algemeen. In tegenstelling tot het beeld dat enkele critici ons voorhouden lijkt de bedrijfsethiek dus niet het `zwarte schaap' van de toegepaste ethiek te zijn. Deze critici hebben echter wel gelijk wanneer zij stellen dat deze problemen zich voordoen in dit veld en dat bedrijfsethici de implicaties van deze problemen moeten onderkennen. Ik concludeer dat het onmogelijk is om deze problemen met ethiek op te lossen maar dat het tegelijkertijd onvermijdelijk is voor velden van toegepaste ethiek om tot een goede benadering van deze problemen te komen. Enkele condities voor een dergelijke benadering worden geschetst in de epiloog.},

For this so-called privacy regulation, users need to have the respective skills---in other words, they need to have online privacy literacy. In this study, we discuss factors that potentially contribute to and result from online privacy literacy. In an online questionnaire with 630 Facebook users, we found that people who spend more time on Facebook and who have changed their privacy settings more frequently reported to have more online privacy literacy. People with more online privacy literacy, in turn, felt more secure on Facebook and implemented more social privacy settings. A mediation analysis showed that time spend on Facebook and experience with privacy regulation did not per se increase safety and privacy behavior directly, stressing the importance of online privacy literacy as a mediator to a safe and privacy-enhancing online behavior. We conclude that Internet experience leads to more online privacy literacy, which fosters a more cautious privacy behavior on SNSs.},

Beginning from the idea of entangled modernities which threaten their own foundations, Ulrich Beck advocated a complete conceptual innovation of sociology in order to better comprehend the fundamental fragility and mutability of societal dynamics shaped by the globalization of capital and risks today. More specifically, he proposed a cosmopolitan turn of sociology: first, by criticizing methodological nationalism; second, by introducing the concept of cosmopolitization; third, by re-mapping social inequalities; fourth, by discussing risk society in the context of East Asian development; and fifth and finally, by proposing a cosmopolitan vision. Along this line, Beck attempted an overview of the researches done on second modern transformation in East Asia and suggested that an active dialogue may be possible when Asians begin to see the West from their perspectives rather than being caught in the Euro-centric and West-hegemonic presuppositions.},

However, like any valuable resource, the competition to govern personal data is subject to existing power relations, political interests, institutional pathways and ideologies. With evidence from Indonesia, this article shows how the governance of personal data in the digital economy is influenced by international and national commercial interests, and instrumentalised by domestic state and political elite. In doing so, it adapts the North American`information-security complex'for developing countries with their post-colonial economies, self-interested oligarchic elites and hybrid state-commercial data firms. The significance of this approach lies in its realistic understanding of the challenges and opportunities for supporting data governance reform around the world.},

  abstract = {This article examines the history of antitrust cases against Big Tech companies in the United States. It highlights a shift in the attitudes of enforcers away from the economic-analysis-informed Chicago and post-Chicago schools of antitrust thought, which are informed by economic analysis, towards New Brandeisian thinking, which emphasizes structural concerns and broader consumer welfare. However, it has yet to catch on in courtrooms. By contrasting the US's antitrust strategy with those of the European Union and China, we argue that antitrust enforcement may hinder economic and technological competitiveness in the short term, but may have long-term benefits. Regarding global digital sovereignty, the US increasing enforcement likely would not impact its global competitiveness, as it still presents a more favorable regulatory environment than the EU, and targeted economic measures prevent Chinese companies from being competitive in the US. New legislation may help address the complexities of modern digital markets so that the US can maintain its competitive edge in technology while enhancing consumer welfare.},

It uniquely identifies the factors affecting the digital divide that have emerged in recent years (2017--2021) as well as investigate if there are new forms or levels of the divide that have surfaced in recent literature. The findings, based on 50 included studies, show that the factors affecting the digital divide can be classified into three different segments and nine main categories: sociodemographic, socioeconomic, personal elements, social support, type of technology, digital training, rights, infrastructure, and large-scale events. Out of all factors, education has been linked to the digital divide the most. The majority of recent literature have studied Level 2 of the divide. Also, only one article in the sample has considered the digital divide at the firm level. Findings also show that a new form, type-of-internet access, and two potential new levels of the digital divide, algorithmic awareness and data inequalities, have been identified in the contemporary literature. The results contribute to the understanding and development of the different perspectives of the digital divide concept. They also contribute to the stream of literature on the determinants of the divide and to the social inequalities and digital inclusion literature. This review can be seen as a guide for managers to realize and understand the forms that the divide can take and to delve into their organizational capabilities on the digitalization front and evaluate where further development is needed within their organizations to help diminish the divide.},

These types of guidelines are necessary and useful, but understanding them can be overwhelming. Academic libraries increasingly rely on third-party, cloudbased vendors to manage their systems and to provide access to their collections. When selecting library systems, library staff must understand privacy issues and be aware of how vendors use data. However, libraries do not always have the staffing, time or knowledge, and vendors are not always interested in upholding library values. The project examines the content of privacy policies for popular library systems used by Canadian academic libraries. The research aims to help librarians better understand the policies, to help them make informed decisions about their own library systems. The process used to code the privacy policies and the results of the coding are included alongside recommendations for vendors and library employees. Building on two seminal privacy studies, the methodology is revised for a Canadian context and updated with today's terminology and context, making it adaptable for other libraries and context around the world.},

Public attention focused on its ban in India following nationwide protests about net neutrality. In Africa, however, Free Basics expanded without much public scrutiny to some 32 countries. This article traces this quiet expansion by using an innovative virtual private network (VPN)-based method and by calling for an analytical focus on the landscape of the digital civil society in Africa. Specifically, I outline two key, interrelated phenomena: (1) Facebook?s evolving strategy, including a greater engagement with civil society organizations and (2) the focus of digital rights activists in Africa on issues like Internet shutdowns, government surveillance, and the lack of data privacy frameworks. In the process, I illuminate broader trends in the digital industry including tech corporations? growing investments in mobile social media, network infrastructures, and in civil society; the use of disadvantaged populations and unregulated territories for digital experiments and data extraction; and the mounting recognition of Facebook?s political role, both within and outside the corporation.},

  abstract = {Whilst learning analytics is still nascent in most African higher education institutions, many African higher education institutions use learning platforms and analytic services from providers outside of the African continent. A critical consideration of the protection of data privacy on the African continent and its implications for learning analytics in African higher education is therefore needed. In this paper, we map the current state of legal and regulatory environments and frameworks on privacy to establish their implications for learning analytics. This scoping review of privacy regulations in 32 African countries, complemented by 15 scholarly papers, revealed that there are numerous national and regional legislation and regulatory frameworks, providing clear pointers pertaining to (student) data privacy to governments, higher education institutions and researchers. As such, the findings of this research have implications for African higher education to ensure not only legal compliance but also to oversee and safeguard student data privacy as part of their fiduciary duty. This research provides crucial insights regarding the importance of context for thinking about the expansion and institutional adoption of learning analytics. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Personal data have become commodified and are regarded as a valuable commercial asset. The commercial value of data relies on the collection and analysis of increasing volumes, granularity, variety and velocity of personal data (both identifiable and aggregated). Africa and African higher education are regarded as new data frontiers to be exploited. What this paper adds This paper, for the first time, makes an attempt to map privacy legislation and academic research on (student) data privacy in the African continent. Maps key implications for African higher educations to consider in collecting, analysing, using and sharing student data. It provides pointers for a research agenda pertaining to student data privacy on the African continent. Implications for practice and/or policy African higher education institutions should consider student data privacy when entering into service level agreements with educational technology and platform providers. African governments should develop common data sharing frameworks to facilitate cross-border data transfer. Current African data privacy legislation provides important implications for the adoption and institutionalisation of learning analytics. African higher education also has to consider the ethical aspects of learning analytics.},

Despite its wide-spread deployment and its potential impact on bridging the digital divide, to date, few studies have rigorously measured the quality of the free Internet service offered by Free Basics. In this short paper, we characterize the quality of the Free Basics service offered in Pakistan and South Africa along three dimensions: (i) the selection of accessible Web services, (ii) the functionality of those services, and (iii) the network performance for those services. While preliminary, our findings show that datadriven studies are essential for having more informed public debates on the pros and cons of the current design of the Free Basics service.},

  abstract = {A series of weaknesses in creativity, research design, and quality of writing continue to handicap energy social science. Many studies ask uninteresting research questions, make only marginal contributions, and lack innovative methods or application to theory. Many studies also have no explicit research design, lack rigor, or suffer from mangled structure and poor quality of writing. To help remedy these shortcomings, this Review offers suggestions for how to construct research questions; thoughtfully engage with concepts; state objectives; and appropriately select research methods. Then, the Review offers suggestions for enhancing theoretical, methodological, and empirical novelty. In terms of rigor, codes of practice are presented across seven method categories: experiments, literature reviews, data collection, data analysis, quantitative energy modeling, qualitative analysis, and case studies. We also recommend that researchers beware of hierarchies of evidence utilized in some disciplines, and that researchers place more emphasis on balance and appropriateness in research design. In terms of style, we offer tips regarding macro and microstructure and analysis, as well as coherent writing. Our hope is that this Review will inspire more interesting, robust, multi-method, comparative, interdisciplinary and impactful research that will accelerate the contribution that energy social science can make to both theory and practice.},

  abstract = {The push in Africa for the widespread adoption of telecommunications and Internet is aimed at boosting economic growth and access to digital government services. However, it has significant effects on privacy by enabling surveillance of the networks, by allowing the collection of data about customers, their locations and transactions, which can be linked to other data and analysed for commercial or governmental purposes. Data can also be stolen or destroyed, by criminals, foreign powers and terrorists. While countries have enthusiastically created telecommunications regulatory authorities, they have only rarely created data protection authorities to oversee well established principles for the collection, use and storage of data. Similarly, they have lagged on the introduction of strategies for cybersecurity and the centres needed to collect data on attacks and defences. Surveillance by secret police has grown in sophistication, with facilities for lawful interception, IMSIcatchers and surveillance RATs, none of which is overseen by parliaments or the courts. Consequently, the rights to dignity and privacy are very poorly observed and more often breached.},

  abstract = {Third-party cookies and related ``offsite'' tracking technologies are frequently used to share user data across applications in support of ad delivery. These data are viewed as highly valuable for online advertisers, but their usage faces increasing headwinds. In this paper, we quantify the benefit to advertisers from using such offsite tracking data in their ad delivery. With this goal in mind, we conduct a large-scale, randomized experiment that includes more than 70,000 advertisers on Facebook and Instagram. We first estimate advertising effectiveness at baseline across our broad sample. We then estimate the change in effectiveness of the same campaigns were advertisers to lose the ability to optimize ad delivery with offsite data. In each of these cases, we use recently developed deconvolution techniques to flexibly estimate the underlying distribution of effects. We find a median cost per incremental customer at baseline of \$38.16 that under the median loss in effectiveness would rise to \$49.93, a 31\% increase. Further, we find ads targeted using offsite data generate more long-term customers per dollar than those without, and losing offsite data disproportionately hurts small scale advertisers. Taken together, our results suggest that offsite data bring large benefits to a wide range of advertisers. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract = {Libraries and librarians have dealt with patron privacy issues since their inception, often serving as educators and advocates. In today's social media-filled landscape, patron privacy has moved from the safeguarding of traditional library records to the creation, use, and ownership of information maintained in an online world. As the core educators for many aspects of literacy, librarians need to keep pace with the issues their users face daily. This paper centers on privacy literacy as an independent area of instruction for library sessions. It reviews a theoretical framework to support privacy literacy instruction and showcases resources and tools for creating privacy literacy education. Finally, privacy issues in healthcare are used to demonstrate the potential impact of privacy literacy instruction.},

  abstract = {Data is the new buzzword in academic libraries, as policy increasingly mandates that data must be open and accessible, funders require formal data management plans, and institutions are implementing guidelines around best practice. Given concerns about the current data management practices of researchers, this paper reports on the initial findings from a project being undertaken at Griffith University to apply a conceptual (A-COM-B) framework to understanding researchers' behaviour. The objective of the project is to encourage the use of institutionally endorsed solutions for research data management. Based on interviews conducted by a team of librarians in a small, social science research centre, preliminary results indicate that attitude is the key element which will need to be addressed in designing intervention strategies to modify behaviour. The paper concludes with a discussion of the next stages in the project, which involve further data collection and analysis, the implementation of targeted strategies, and a follow-up activity to assess the extent of modifications to current undesirable practices.},

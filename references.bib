We use three themes to connect insights from social and behavioral sciences: people's uncertainty about the consequences of privacy-related behaviors and their own preferences over those consequences; the context-dependence of people's concern, or lack thereof, about privacy; and the degree to which privacy concerns are malleable---manipulable by commercial and governmental interests. Organizing our discussion by these themes, we offer observations concerning the role of public policy in the protection of privacy in the information age.},

  abstract = {Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive societal problem that affects millions of people around the world. IPV perpetrators increasingly weaponize digital technologies like mobile applications (``apps'') to spy on, monitor, and harass victims. Surveillance-capable apps can have legitimate use cases, for example, locating children, and are therefore easily available on various mobile app stores like the Google Play Store. Nevertheless, these applications are easily repurposed by abusers to track their victims. The problem of such dual-use apps in IPV is global. However, current understanding of the ecosystem of such apps is limited to English-language apps, potentially limiting its relevance to non-English speaking IPV survivors across the world. In this paper, we study the prevalence of dualuse applications found in 15 languages and 27 countries. We collected 51,868 unique apps in 2020 from the Google Play Store, using queries such as ``track wife's location.'' Through a semi-manual analysis of a subset of these apps, we discovered 854 unique dualuse apps, and estimate that among the apps collected from Google Play, 3,988 are dual-use apps. We found notable differences in app search results, suggested queries, and marketed capabilities of dual-use apps across different languages. For instance, we identified that 18\% of dual-use apps do not have an English description, and 28\% could not be found using English queries. Google Play (cursorily) blocks certain queries referring explicitly to intimate partner surveillance (IPS) to discourage potential abusers, but the blocking efficacy varies across languages. For example, we found that 80\% of explicit IPS queries for English are blocked, but none for Bengali, Chinese, Hindi, Malay, Thai, and Vietnamese. Thus, abusers fluent in those languages can evade such blocking with no effort.},

This paper presents a statistical forecasting approach to predict the outbreak of food crises with sufficient lead time for preventive action. Different use cases are explored related to possible alternative targeting policies and the levels at which finance is typically unlocked. The results indicate that, particularly at longer forecasting horizons, the statistical predictions compare favorably to expert-based outlooks. The paper concludes that statistical models demonstrate good ability to detect future outbreaks of food crises and that using statistical forecasting approaches may help increase lead time for action.},

As societies grapple with the implications of AI on creative life, there is an opportunity to reevaluate the creative contributions of Global South cultures, ensuring they are acknowledged and foregrounded in the evolving landscape of human and machine creativity. This paper calls for reimagining and restructuring creative value with the emergence of AI enabled technologies by broadening who and what counts as creative in this data-driven era. To democratize creativity, a decolonial and indigenous framework of cross-cultural creative value is needed which critically intersects and examines the relations between creative labor, rights, and learning. The study of the Global South's data economies is important not only to harness its potential but also to address the cross-cultural ethics of building Creative AI tools with data from their underrepresented communities. At its core, the creative data justice framework emphasizes the need to challenge the existing power imbalances in global data governance. This paper proposes that fair creative value can be achieved by drawing inspiration from indigenous systems of care as a counterforce to neoliberal values of efficiency and utility. This framework will help scholars, policymakers and designers in their inclusive approaches to creativity in the age of AI.},

As technology companies expand their reach worldwide, the notion of privacy continues to be viewed through an ethnocentric lens. It disproportionately draws from empirical evidence on Western-based, white, and middle-class demographics. We need to break away from the market-driven neoliberal ideology and the Development paradigm long dictating media studies if we are to foster more inclusive privacy policies. This paper offers a set of propositions to de-naturalize and estrange data from demographic generalizations and cultural assumptions, namely, (1) predicting privacy harms through the history of social practice, (2) recalibrating the core-periphery as evolving and moving targets, and (3) de-exoticizing ``natives'' by situating privacy in ludic digital cultures. In essence, decolonizing privacy studies is as much an act of reimagining people and place as it is of dismantling essentialisms that are regurgitated through scholarship.},

  title = {Impossible and Inevitable: {{Reconstructing}} the Critique of Business Ethics},
  author = {Meijer, Kim},
  year = 2023,
  month = dec,
  abstract = {Business ethics is a booming subject. Most universities and business schools offer business ethics courses, and many larger businesses have an ethics program in place. Nevertheless, business ethics has a troubled history. The field has been criticized as shallow, simple, and, worst of all, hypocritical. Why, then, is business ethics met with such criticism? Is there something amiss with business ethics in particular, or do other fields of applied ethics face the same criticism? This study set out to address these questions by analyzing the academic critique of business ethics. This examination helps us to develop a better understanding of business ethics itself; that is, of the attempt to apply ethics to business settings. The study starts with a reflection on the early development of business ethics as a `practical' approach to ethics that aimed to appeal strongly to the business world. I show that this development made the field vulnerable to criticism. I then employ a literature review to reconstruct the academic critique of business ethics and to highlight five of its `central problems.' These problems mostly revolve around an alleged misunderstanding of ethics in business ethics. There are critics who frame these problems as specific for business ethics; as if these problems occur in business ethics only. In so doing, business ethics appears to be depicted as the `black sheep' of applied ethics. I, however, hypothesize these problems are related to ethics in general. A problem of ethics in general can be related to each attempt to apply ethics and, therefore, to all fields of applied ethics.Two methods are used to support this hypothesis. A comparative analysis of the critique of business ethics and the critique of bioethics shows that similar problems are related to the latter field. Following this, a hermeneutical study of the philosophical views of Emmanuel Levinas (on the `trauma' of ethics) and Simone de Beauvoir (on the `ambiguity' of ethics) shows that these are indeed problems of ethics in general. Therefore, I conclude these critics are largely mistaken to frame these problems as specific for business ethics and, thus, to depict this field as the `black sheep' of applied ethics. And yet, these critics are not mistaken for bringing these problems to our attention; and for arguing that business ethicists should take these problems seriously. I conclude that it is impossible to resolve these problems but, at the same time, inevitable for fields of applied ethics -- such as business ethics -- to develop approaches to them. Several conditions for approaching these problems are sketched in the epilogue to the study. -De bedrijfsethiek heeft twee gezichten. Aan de ene kant is het een zeer succesvol veld. De meeste universiteiten en hogescholen bieden cursussen bedrijfsethiek aan en vrijwel alle grotere bedrijven hebben een ethiekprogramma (e.g., ethische code of ethiek trainingen). De bedrijfsethiek heeft echter ook een andere kant. Al sinds de oprichting wordt het veld bestookt met felle en fundamentele kritiek. Volgens sommige critici is de moderne bedrijfsethiek niet alleen oppervlakkig en simpel; het is ook een uitermate hypocriet veld. Hoe komt het dat de bedrijfsethiek zo kwetsbaar is voor kritiek? En is deze kritiek alleen van toepassing op bedrijfsethiek, of hebben andere velden van toegepaste ethiek te maken met dezelfde kritiek? Om deze vragen te beantwoorden start ik met een reconstructie van de wetenschappelijke kritiek op de bedrijfsethiek. Ik laat zien dat er ten minste vijf centrale problemen met de bedrijfsethiek zijn. Het gros van deze problemen draait om de notie dat de moderne bedrijfsethiek niet begrijpt waar ethiek over gaat. Er is echter iets merkwaardigs aan deze kritiek; enkele prominente critici presenteren deze problemen alsof ze specifiek zijn voor bedrijfsethiek; alsof deze problemen zich alleen voordoen in dit veld. Hiermee wordt de bedrijfsethiek als het `zwarte schaap' van de toegepaste ethiek neergezet. Ik plaats deze manier van presenteren tussen haakjes en stel dat de problemen van de bedrijfsethiek lijken op problemen van de ethiek in het algemeen. Dit type problemen kan zich voordoen in iedere poging om ethiek toe te passen, en daarmee dus in ieder veld van toegepaste ethiek. Ik gebruik twee methodes om deze hypothese te onderzoeken. Een vergelijkende analyse tussen kritieken op bedrijfsethiek en bio-ethiek laat zien dat de vermeende problemen van de bedrijfsethiek zich in beide velden voordoen. En een hermeneutische studie van argumenten in het werk van Emmanuel Levinas (over ethiek en `trauma') en Simone de Beauvoir (over ethiek en `ambigu\"iteit') toont dat we hier inderdaad te maken hebben met problemen van de ethiek in het algemeen. In tegenstelling tot het beeld dat enkele critici ons voorhouden lijkt de bedrijfsethiek dus niet het `zwarte schaap' van de toegepaste ethiek te zijn. Deze critici hebben echter wel gelijk wanneer zij stellen dat deze problemen zich voordoen in dit veld en dat bedrijfsethici de implicaties van deze problemen moeten onderkennen. Ik concludeer dat het onmogelijk is om deze problemen met ethiek op te lossen maar dat het tegelijkertijd onvermijdelijk is voor velden van toegepaste ethiek om tot een goede benadering van deze problemen te komen. Enkele condities voor een dergelijke benadering worden geschetst in de epiloog.},

Through exploratory factor analysis, a three-factor structure~of students'~perspectives (ChatGPT academic benefits, ChatGPT academic concerns, and accessibility and attitude towards ChatGPT) was identified. A confirmatory factor analysis was carried out to confirm the identified factors. The majority of students are aware of and recognize the potential of Gen AI tools like ChatGPT in supporting their learning. However, a significant number of students reported using ChatGPT mainly for non-academic purposes, citing concerns such as academic policy violations, excessive reliance on technology, lack of originality in assignments, and potential security risks. Students mainly use ChatGPT for assignments rather than for class or group projects. Students noted that they have not received any training on how to use ChatGPT safely and effectively. The implications for policy and practice are discussed in terms of how well-informed policy guidelines and strategies on the use of Gen AI tools like ChatGPT can support teaching and improve student learning.},

We formalize some aspects of contextual integrity in a logical framework for expressing and reasoning about norms of transmission of personal information. In comparison with access control and privacy policy frameworks such as RBAC, EPAL, and P3P, these norms focus on who personal information is about, how it is transmitted, and past and future actions by both the subject and the users of the information. Norms can be positive or negative depending on whether they refer to actions that are allowed or disallowed. Our model is expressive enough to capture naturally many notions of privacy found in legislation, including those found in HIPAA, COPPA, and GLBA. A number of important problems regarding compliance with privacy norms, future requirements associated with specific actions, and relations between policies and legal standards reduce to standard decision procedures for temporal logic.},

In this study, we discuss factors that potentially contribute to and result from online privacy literacy. In an online questionnaire with 630 Facebook users, we found that people who spend more time on Facebook and who have changed their privacy settings more frequently reported to have more online privacy literacy. People with more online privacy literacy, in turn, felt more secure on Facebook and implemented more social privacy settings. A mediation analysis showed that time spend on Facebook and experience with privacy regulation did not per se increase safety and privacy behavior directly, stressing the importance of online privacy literacy as a mediator to a safe and privacy-enhancing online behavior.

  abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, the impact of AI tools on software development in the wild remains understudied. We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the productivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an average of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow or disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers primarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet. Before starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce completion time by 24\%. After completing the study, developers estimate that allowing AI reduced completion time by 20\%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing AI actually increases completion time by 19\%--AI tooling slowed developers down. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39\% shorter) and ML (38\% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and evaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could contribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality standards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although the influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the robustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely to primarily be a function of our experimental design.},

  abstract = {This text was prepared for presentation in Nagoya, Japan, in 2010. Its aim was to explore a dialogue with Asians toward a cosmopolitan sociology. Beginning from the idea of entangled modernities which threaten their own foundations, Ulrich Beck advocated a complete conceptual innovation of sociology in order to better comprehend the fundamental fragility and mutability of societal dynamics shaped by the globalization of capital and risks today. More specifically, he proposed a cosmopolitan turn of sociology: first, by criticizing methodological nationalism; second, by introducing the concept of cosmopolitization; third, by re-mapping social inequalities; fourth, by discussing risk society in the context of East Asian development; and fifth and finally, by proposing a cosmopolitan vision. Along this line, Beck attempted an overview of the researches done on second modern transformation in East Asia and suggested that an active dialogue may be possible when Asians begin to see the West from their perspectives rather than being caught in the Euro-centric and West-hegemonic presuppositions.},

BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

Control over these data assets seems to explain the emergence and dominance of so-called ?Big Tech? firms, consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google/Alphabet, and Facebook. These US-based firms are some of the largest in the world by market capitalization, a position that they retain despite growing policy and public condemnation?or ?techlash??of their market power based on their monopolistic control of personal data. We analyse the transformation of personal data into an asset in order to explore how personal data is accounted for, governed, and valued by Big Tech firms and other political-economic actors (e.g., investors). However, our findings show that Big Tech firms turn ?users? and ?user engagement? into assets through the performative measurement, governance, and valuation of user metrics (e.g., user numbers, user engagement), rather than extending ownership and control rights over personal data per se. We conceptualize this strategy as a form of ?techcraft? to center attention on the means and mechanisms that Big Tech firms deploy to make users and user data measurable and legible as future revenue streams.},

Such work looks at the processes and discrete moments in development that led to certain knowledges being represented and other knowledges remaining invisible. In this paper I build on these conversations by exploring the knowledge politics of digital humanitarianism. Digital humanitarianism, a technological corollary to the geoweb, is the set of social and institutional networks, technologies, and practices that enable large numbers of remote and on-theground individuals to collaborate on humanitarian projects. Specifically, in this paper I offer 4 ``moments of closure'' when knowledge politics have been negotiated, enacted, and made durable in digital humanitarianism. These moments of closure constellate around the themes of inclusion, categorization, accuracy, and visibility. I then consider the implications of these moments for the kinds of epistemologies digital humanitarianism espouses, and how knowledges come to be represented. I argue that these knowledge politics -- the struggles for legitimacy and means of representation -- are fluid and contested, yet become more stable when implemented through technology. Through these processes digital humanitarianism, and by extension the geoweb, embodies the social relations that first produced the debates around knowledge representation.},

Within digital humanitarianism, Big Data has featured strongly in recent efforts to improve digital humanitarian work. This shift toward social media and other Big Data sources has entailed unexamined assumptions about technological progress, social change, and the kinds of knowledge captured by data. These assumptions stand in tension with critical geographic scholarship, and in particular critical GIS research. In this paper I borrow from critical research on technologies to engage three important new facets of Big Data emerging from an interrogation of digital humanitarianism. I argue first that within digital humanitarianism, Big Data should be understood as a new set of practices, in addition to its usual conception as data and analytics technologies. Second, I argue that Big Data constitutes a distinct epistemology that obscures many forms of knowledge in crises and emergencies and produces a limited understanding of how a crisis is unfolding. Third, I argue that Big Data is constitutive of a social relation in which both the formal humanitarian sector and ``victims'' of crises are in need of the services and labor that can be provided by digital humanitarians.},

As algorithmic systems are deployed across domains such as transport, welfare, housing, education, and security, cities become both laboratories of innovation and battlegrounds of democratic legitimacy. Trustworthy AI has emerged as a policy imperative-but the question remains: trustworthy for whom? Rather than treating trust as a static feature of technical systems, this Special Issue reframes it as a relational, contested, and institutionally mediated concept-fundamental to the legitimacy of public action in the digital age. Contributions are encouraged that explore GenAI not only as a technological advance, but as a governance challenge that reconfigures discretion, authority, and the social contract between citizens and institutions. Inspired by Richard R. Nelson's enduring metaphor of "The Moon and the Ghetto"-which captures the asymmetries between technological sophistication and social equity-this Special Issue invites a renewed interrogation of how AI policy can bridge systemic inequalities rather than entrench them. Urban governance frameworks must move beyond techno-solutionism to embed pluralism, accountability, and public value at the core of GenAI deployments. Scholars, policymakers, and practitioners are invited to submit empirical, theoretical, and policy-oriented contributions that critically examine how Urban AI can be governed with legitimacy, reflexivity, and justice.},

These extracted examples include (public) personally identifiable information (names, phone numbers, and email addresses), IRC conversations, code, and 128-bit UUIDs. Our attack is possible even though each of the above sequences are included in just one document in the training data. We comprehensively evaluate our extraction attack to understand the factors that contribute to its success. Worryingly, we find that larger models are more vulnerable than smaller models.

  abstract = {We are often told that data are the new oil. But unlike oil, data are not a substance found in nature. It must be appropriated. The capture and processing of social data unfolds through a process we call data relations, which ensures the ``natural'' conversion of daily life into a data stream. The result is nothing less than a new social order, based on continuous tracking, and offering unprecedented new opportunities for social discrimination and behavioral influence. We propose that this process is best understood through the history of colonialism. Thus, data relations enact a new form of data colonialism, normalizing the exploitation of human beings through data, just as historic colonialism appropriated territory and resources and ruled subjects for profit. Data colonialism paves the way for a new stage of capitalism whose outlines we only glimpse: the capitalization of life without limit.},

Concerns about privacy ethics, class division and the specter of AI-incited biowarfare controlled by supremacist-minded entities that benefit from the datafication of individuals for economic profit and the attainment of politicized control-seeking objectives are the axial arguments of this position paper. As a result, this review makes a case that AI is being used as a tool of hegemony by presenting an analytical framework derived from the `less mainstream' varied corpus of literature published between 1984 and 2024. Furthermore, while the literature also reveals attempts to monitor misuse of AI, to date there have been no solutions offered concerning privacy and surveillance, alternatives to the potential loss of jobs through automated AI or the menace of AI-operated biological warfare already being tested in war-torn parts of the world. Resolving the existing hegemonic challenges is of paramount importance and must be properly addressed in order not to be met with an existential crisis threatening the continuity of humanity.},

Recent shifts in technologies around machine learning and artificial intelligence have intensified these concerns. This editorial introduces the articles in the special theme on digital resignation and privacy cynicism: concepts developed in the past decade to explain the growing powerlessness individuals feel in relation to their digital privacy even as they continue to experience consternation over the collection and use of their personal information. The papers in this special theme engage and extend existing research on these topics. The original articles and commentaries pose theoretical and practical questions related to the ways people confront the powerful institutional forces that increasingly shape many aspects of the information environment. They employ several methodologies and theoretical perspectives and extend the range of geographic, political, cultural, and institutional contexts in which privacy cynicism and digital resignation can be identified and examined. In addition to contextualizing these contributions, this editorial maps a range of related concepts including digital resignation, privacy cynicism, privacy apathy, surveillance realism, privacy fatigue, and privacy helplessness. It concludes by identifying key themes across the papers in this collection and provides directions for future research.},

The article constructs an analytical framework in order to scrutinise the three main claims made on behalf of technologically advanced humanitarian information systems: that they can access data more accurately, more quickly, and alter power relations in emancipatory ways. It does so in relation to two aspects of digital humanitarianism: visual technology and crisis mapping, and big data. The article is partly informed by a historical perspective, but also by interview and other material that suggests some of the claims made on behalf of technology are exaggerated. In particular, we argue that the enthusiasm for the data is vastly outstripped by the capacity to meaningfully analyse it. We conclude by sco}

But as with all powerful tools, they come with their shadows. Picture living in a world where deepfakes are indistinguishable from reality, where synthetic identities orchestrate malicious campaigns, and where targeted misinformation or scams are crafted with unparalleled precision. Welcome to the darker side of GenAI applications. This article is not just a journey through the meanders of potential misuse of GenAI and LLMs, but also a call to recognize the urgency of the challenges ahead. As we navigate the seas of misinformation campaigns, malicious content generation, and the eerie creation of sophisticated malware, we'll uncover the societal implications that ripple through the GenAI revolution we are witnessing. From AI-powered botnets on social media platforms to the unnerving potential of AI to generate fabricated identities, or alibis made of synthetic realities, the stakes have never been higher. The lines between the virtual and the real worlds are blurring, and the consequences of potential GenAI's nefarious applications impact us all. This article serves both as a synthesis of rigorous research presented on the risks of GenAI and misuse of LLMs and as a thought-provoking vision of the different types of harmful GenAI applications we might encounter in the near future, and some ways we can prepare for them.},

Drawing on scholarship from Couldry and Mejias, Zuboff, Kwet, Sassen, Noble, among others, the paper argues that contemporary practices of massive data extraction by global corporations and state actors replicate exploitative colonial logics. Data colonialism thus emerges not merely as a metaphor but as a new stage of historical colonialism, characterized by asymmetrical geopolitical relations and infrastructural invisibility that systematically extract personal and behavioral data, primarily benefiting global technology corporations and dominant states. The study critically analyzes concepts like surveillance capitalism, datafication, data extractivism, data imperialism, and digital sovereignty, examining specific cases from Brazil, the United States, the European Union, and China. Ultimately, the paper argues that combating digital colonialism requires more than regulatory interventions; it demands a fundamental cognitive shift---the Cognitive Reappropriation of Data---that empowers individuals and communities to critically engage with how their data is appropriated, monetized, and governed.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are increasingly being integrated into educational environments, prompting questions about their actual impact on student learning. While a growing body of literature reports anecdotal or correlational evidence of GenAI's educational potential, rigorous causal evaluations remain limited. To bridge this gap, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental and quasi-experimental studies investigating the effect of GenAI on learning outcomes. Following PRISMA guidelines, we screened five academic databases and identified 68 relevant studies published between 2022 and 2025. These studies yielded a total of 337 effect sizes across various educational levels, subject domains, and instructional contexts. The meta-analysis revealed a moderate overall positive effect of GenAI on learning outcomes (SMD~=~0.45, 95~\% CI [0.43, 0.47]), suggesting that GenAI-supported interventions are generally more effective than traditional instruction. However, substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies (I2~=~95~\%), indicating that the magnitude of GenAI's impact varies significantly depending on contextual and methodological factors. Moderator analyses revealed stronger effects in primary and secondary education, within natural science disciplines, and in short-term interventions with smaller sample sizes. These patterns point to both the promise and the complexity of GenAI integration in educational practice. In conclusion, while GenAI shows considerable promise for enhancing learning outcomes, its true potential will only be realized through sustained, efforts to evaluate how, when, and for whom these technologies work best in diverse learning ecosystems.},

However, like any valuable resource, the competition to govern personal data is subject to existing power relations, political interests, institutional pathways and ideologies. With evidence from Indonesia, this article shows how the governance of personal data in the digital economy is influenced by international and national commercial interests, and instrumentalised by domestic state and political elite. In doing so, it adapts the North American`information-security complex'for developing countries with their post-colonial economies, self-interested oligarchic elites and hybrid state-commercial data firms. The significance of this approach lies in its realistic understanding of the challenges and opportunities for supporting data governance reform around the world.},

However, it has yet to catch on in courtrooms. By contrasting the US's antitrust strategy with those of the European Union and China, we argue that antitrust enforcement may hinder economic and technological competitiveness in the short term, but may have long-term benefits. Regarding global digital sovereignty, the US increasing enforcement likely would not impact its global competitiveness, as it still presents a more favorable regulatory environment than the EU, and targeted economic measures prevent Chinese companies from being competitive in the US. New legislation may help address the complexities of modern digital markets so that the US can maintain its competitive edge in technology while enhancing consumer welfare.},

Results showed that participants disclosed more information in their blog entries when they were more visually identified (sharing a picture of themselves), contrary to the assumptions of the online disinhibition effect.

However, the lack of in-depth examination of ChatGPT's response quality could be concerning when it is used for personal topics like mental health issues and intimate relationship problems. In these topics, a piece of misleading advice could cause harmful repercussions. In response to people's growing interest in using ChatGPT as a relationship advisor, our research evaluates ChatGPT's proficiency in discerning relationship advice. Specifically, we investigate its alignment with human judgements. We conducted our analysis with 13,138 Reddit posts about intimate relationship problems to examine the overall alignment. Furthermore, we investigate ChatGPT's consistency in judging intimate relationship advice by re-prompting identical queries. Our results indicate a significant disparity between ChatGPT and human judgments, with the model displaying inconsistency in its own decisions. Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive insights into ChatGPT's mechanisms for intimacy problems and future improvements in its proficiency in helping people's relationship struggles.},

It can provide advice on a range of topics, but it is unclear how good this advice is relative to that provided by competent humans, especially in situations where empathy is required. Here, we report the first investigation of whether ChatGPT's responses are perceived as better than those of humans in a task where humans were attempting to be empathetic. Fifty social dilemma questions were randomly selected from 10 well-known advice columns. In a pre-registered survey, participants (               N               \,=\,404) were each shown one question, along with the corresponding response by an advice columnist and by ChatGPT. ChatGPT's advice was perceived as more balanced, complete, empathetic, helpful, and better than the advice provided by professional advice columnists (all values of               p               \,\&lt;\,0.001). Although participants could not determine which response was written by ChatGPT (54\%,               p               \,=\,0.29), most participants preferred that their own social dilemma questions be answered by a human than by a computer (77\%,               p               \,\&lt;\,0.001). ChatGPT's responses were longer than those produced by the advice columnists (mean 280.9 words vs. 142.2 words,               p               \,\&lt;\,0.001). In a second pre-registered survey, each ChatGPT answer was constrained to be approximately the same length as that of the advice columnist (mean 143.2 vs. 142.2 words,               p               \,=\,0.95).

  abstract = {Intelligent chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) have recently been sweeping the world, with potential for a wide variety of industrial applications. Global frontier technology companies are feverishly participating in LLM-powered chatbot design and development, providing several alternatives beyond the famous ChatGPT. However, training, fine-tuning, and updating such intelligent chatbots consume substantial amounts of electricity, resulting in significant carbon emissions. The research and development of all intelligent LLMs and software, hardware manufacturing (e.g., graphics processing units and supercomputers), related data/operations management, and material recycling supporting chatbot services are associated with carbon emissions to varying extents. Attention should therefore be paid to the entire life-cycle energy and carbon footprints of LLM-powered intelligent chatbots in both the present and future in order to mitigate their climate change impact. In this work, we clarify and highlight the energy consumption and carbon emission implications of eight main phases throughout the life cycle of the development of such intelligent chatbots. Based on a life-cycle and interaction analysis of these phases, we propose a system-level solution with three strategic pathways to optimize the management of this industry and mitigate the related footprints. While anticipating the enormous potential of this advanced technology and its products, we make an appeal for a rethinking of the mitigation pathways and strategies of the life-cycle energy usage and carbon emissions of the LLM-powered intelligent chatbot industry and a reshaping of their energy and environmental implications at this early stage of development.},

  abstract = {Mobile applications (also known as ``apps'') have rapidly grown into a multibillion-dollar industry. Because they are available through devices that are ``always on'' and often with the user, users often adopt mobile apps ``on the fly'' as they need them. As a result, users often base their adoption and disclosure decisions only on the information provided through the mobile app delivery platform (e.g., the Apple App Store™ or Google Play™). The fact that using a mobile app often requires one to disclose an unprecedented combination of personal information (e.g., location data, preferences, contacts, calendars, browsing history, music library) means that one makes a complex risk/benefit tradeoff decision based on only the small amount of information that the mobile app delivery platform provides---and all in a short period of time. Hence, this process is much shorter and much riskier than traditional software adoption. Through two experiments involving 1,588 mobile app users, we manipulated three primary sources of information provided by a platform (app quality ratings, network size, and privacy assurances) to understand their effect on perceptions of privacy risks and benefits and, in turn, how they influence consumer adoption intentions and willingness to pay (WTP). We found that network size influenced not only perceived benefits but also the perceived risks of apps in the absence of perfect information. In addition, we found that integrating a third party privacy assurance system into the app platform had a significant influence on app adoption and information disclosure. We also found that a larger network size reduces LBS privacy risk perceptions, which confirms our information cascade hypothesis. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.},

The recent launch of ChatGPT and the rapid popularization of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) act as a focusing event to further accelerate the concentration of power in the hands of the Big Tech. By using Kingdon's multiple streams framework, this article investigates how Big Tech utilize their technological monopoly and political influence to reshape the policy landscape and establish themselves as key actors in the policy process. It explores the implications of the rise of Big Tech for policy theory in two ways.

Recently, many studies have been published to show the effectiveness, efficiency, integration, and sentiments of chatGPT and other LLMs. In contrast, this study focuses on the important aspects that are mostly overlooked, i.e. sustainability, privacy, digital divide, and ethics and suggests that not only chatGPT but every subsequent entry in the category of conversational bots should undergo Sustainability, PrivAcy, Digital divide, and Ethics (SPADE) evaluation. This paper discusses in detail the issues and concerns raised over chatGPT in line with aforementioned characteristics. We also discuss the recent EU AI Act briefly in accordance with the SPADE evaluation. We support our hypothesis by some preliminary data collection and visualizations along with hypothesized facts. We also suggest mitigations and recommendations for each of the concerns. Furthermore, we also suggest some policies and recommendations for EU AI policy act concerning ethics, digital divide, and sustainability.},

Large-language models such as               ChatGPT               , with their vast internet-scale training data, offer transformative potential to address this gap. In this study, we used both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate how well               ChatGPT               can address visualization design questions. First, we quantitatively compared the               ChatGPT               -generated responses with anonymous online               Human               replies to data visualization questions on the VisGuides user forum. Next, we conducted a qualitative user study examining the reactions and attitudes of practitioners toward               ChatGPT               as a visualization design assistant. Participants were asked to bring their visualizations and design questions and received feedback from both               Human               experts and               ChatGPT               in randomized order. Our findings from both studies underscore               ChatGPT               's strengths---particularly its ability to rapidly generate diverse design options---while also highlighting areas for improvement, such as nuanced contextual understanding and fluid interaction dynamics beyond the chat interface. Drawing on these insights, we discuss design considerations for future LLM-based design feedback systems.},

Drawing on concepts from science and technology studies (STS) and innovation research, it critically examines how future-oriented narratives---often framed as inevitable or deterministic---structure public discourse, mobilize resources, and shape expectations. These dynamics are particularly visible in the cases of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and generative AI (GenAI). The  thesis is that AI is, on the one hand, accompanied and propelled by far-reaching promises, while on the other hand diverse application problems and fundamental functional limitations are frequently overlooked. As a result, skeptical and critical perspectives are gaining increasing prominence in the AI discourse. Therefore, the future prospects of AI could be characterized more by a development path that can be described as routinization, and less by the vision of AGI.~However, it is argued that society's fascination with AI goes beyond technological and economic aspects, neglecting application problems and fundamental functional limitations.  This persuasiveness is ultimately based on the vagueness of the term AI and the long-standing myth of the intelligent machine.},

Using South Africa as a case study, it argues that US multinationals exercise imperial control at the architecture level of the digital ecosystem: software, hardware and network connectivity, which then gives rise to related forms of domination. The monopoly power of multinational corporations is used for resource extraction through rent and surveillance ? economic domination. By controlling the digital ecosystem, Big Tech corporations control computer-mediated experiences, giving them direct power over political, economic and cultural domains of life ? imperial control. The centrepiece of surveillance capitalism, Big Data, violates the sanctity of privacy and concentrates economic power in the hands of US corporations ? a system of global surveillance capitalism. As a feature of surveillance capitalism, Global North intelligence agencies partner with their own corporations to conduct mass and targeted surveillance in the Global South ? which intensifies imperial state surveillance. US elites have persuaded people that society must proceed according to its ruling class conceptions of the digital world, setting the foundation for tech hegemony. The author argues for a different ecosystem that decentralises technology by placing control directly into the hands of the people to counter the rapidly advancing frontier of digital empire.},

Data trustees present a promising solution, aiming to balance data utilization with privacy concerns by facilitating secure data sharing and ensuring individual control. However, successful implementation hinges on user acceptance and trust. We conducted a large-scale, vignette-based, census-representative online study examining factors influencing the acceptance of data trustees for medical, automotive, IoT, and online data. With n = 714 participants from Germany and n = 1036 from the US, our study reveals varied willingness to use data trustees across both countries, with notable skepticism and outright rejection from a significant portion of users. We also identified significant domainspecific differences, including the influence of user anonymity, perceived personal and societal benefits, and the recipients of the data. Contrary to common beliefs, organizational and regulatory decisions such as the storage location, the operator, and supervision appeared less relevant to users' decisions. In conclusion, while there exists a potential user base for data trustees, achieving widespread acceptance will require explicit and targeted implementation strategies tailored to address diverse user expectations. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding these nuances for effectively deploying data trustee frameworks that meet both regulatory requirements and user preferences while upholding highest security and privacy standards.},

  abstract = {Objectives The advent of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) systems employing large language models such as ChatGPT has sparked public, professional and academic debates on the capabilities of such technologies. This mixed-methods study sets out to review and systematically explore the capabilities of ChatGPT to adequately provide health advice to patients when prompted regarding four topics from the field of cardiovascular diseases. Methods As of 30 May 2023, 528 items on PubMed contained the term ChatGPT in their title and/or abstract, with 258 being classified as journal articles and included in our thematic state-of-the-art review. For the experimental part, we systematically developed and assessed 123 prompts across the four topics based on three classes of users and two languages. Medical and communications experts scored ChatGPT's responses according to the 4Cs of language model evaluation proposed in this article: correct, concise, comprehensive and comprehensible. Results The articles reviewed were fairly evenly distributed across discussing how ChatGPT could be used for medical publishing, in clinical practice and for education of medical personnel and/or patients. Quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the capability of ChatGPT on the 123 prompts demonstrated that, while the responses generally received above-average scores, they occupy a spectrum from the concise and correct via the absurd to what only can be described as hazardously incorrect and incomplete. Prompts formulated at higher levels of health literacy generally yielded higher-quality answers. Counterintuitively, responses in a lower-resource language were often of higher quality. Conclusions The results emphasise the relationship between prompt and response quality and hint at potentially concerning futures in personalised medicine. The widespread use of large language models for health advice might amplify existing health inequalities and will increase the pressure on healthcare systems by providing easy access to many seemingly likely differential diagnoses and recommendations for seeing a doctor for even harmless ailments.},

As powerful LLMs are devouring existing text data from various domains (e.g., GPT-3 is trained on 45TB texts), it is natural to doubt whether the private information is included in the training data and what privacy threats can these LLMs and their downstream applications bring. In this paper, we study the privacy threats from OpenAI's ChatGPT and the New Bing enhanced by ChatGPT and show that application-integrated LLMs may cause new privacy threats. To this end, we conduct extensive experiments to support our claims and discuss LLMs' privacy implications.},

However, prior research on the security and safety implications of LLMs has primarily focused on their specific versions, overlooking the impact of successive LLM updates. This prompts the need for a holistic understanding of the risks in these different versions of LLMs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we conduct a longitudinal study to examine the adversarial robustness -- specifically misclassification, jailbreak, and hallucination -- of three prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA. Our study reveals that LLM updates do not consistently improve adversarial robustness as expected. For instance, a later version of GPT-3.5 degrades regarding misclassification and hallucination despite its improved resilience against jailbreaks, and GPT-4 demonstrates (incrementally) higher robustness overall. Moreover, larger model sizes do not necessarily yield improved robustness. Specifically, larger LLaMA models do not uniformly exhibit improved robustness across all three aspects studied. Importantly, minor updates lacking substantial robustness improvements can exacerbate existing issues rather than resolve them. By providing a more nuanced understanding of LLM robustness over time, we hope our study can offer valuable insights for developers and users navigating model updates and informed decisions in model development and usage for LLM vendors.},

  abstract = {In 1950, the United Nations established the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which claims credit for essential involvement in refugee issues. UNHCR teams have worked with several standard registration systems which, however, have still needed improvements. The search for the ideal system resulted in the establishment of the registration scheme -- Project Profile, which became the basis for the proGres platform. UNHCR and Microsoft developed a mobile registration database, the proGres Refugee Registration Platform, which provided refugees with new identification documents. In 2006, the UN OIOS (United Nations Office of international Oversight Services) published a report which suggested combining fingerprinting with the new database. The UNHCR officially announced its policy of biometric refugee registration in 2010 and introduced the registration technology in collaboration with several organisations. In addition, the team implemented iris scans into specialized ATMs in Jordan. The most recent registration technology, BIMS (Biometric Identity Management System), was field tested in Thailand in July 2015. The overall outcome was very impressive and the UNHCR plans to continue the application of the technology in the future. The author believes that biometrics contribute to the promotion of national welfare and sees concerns and ethical objections as legitimate, while also recognizing that these issues may contribute to the elimination of defects in the system.},

It uniquely identifies the factors affecting the digital divide that have emerged in recent years (2017--2021) as well as investigate if there are new forms or levels of the divide that have surfaced in recent literature. The findings, based on 50 included studies, show that the factors affecting the digital divide can be classified into three different segments and nine main categories: sociodemographic, socioeconomic, personal elements, social support, type of technology, digital training, rights, infrastructure, and large-scale events. Out of all factors, education has been linked to the digital divide the most. The majority of recent literature have studied Level 2 of the divide. Also, only one article in the sample has considered the digital divide at the firm level. Findings also show that a new form, type-of-internet access, and two potential new levels of the digital divide, algorithmic awareness and data inequalities, have been identified in the contemporary literature. The results contribute to the understanding and development of the different perspectives of the digital divide concept. They also contribute to the stream of literature on the determinants of the divide and to the social inequalities and digital inclusion literature. This review can be seen as a guide for managers to realize and understand the forms that the divide can take and to delve into their organizational capabilities on the digitalization front and evaluate where further development is needed within their organizations to help diminish the divide.},

This leads to a dramatic change to the economic institutions of capitalism---into what could be defined as platform capitalism---that rests on a fundamental dilemma between `decentralization' on the one side and `concentration' on the other. This is the main puzzle that the emergence of a big data driven economy is actually offering to law and economics scholars and to policy makers. This paper introduces to some of the major aspects of this dilemma.},

  abstract = {While privacy is a core value of librarianship, privacy standards differ by library and library vendor. These types of guidelines are necessary and useful, but understanding them can be overwhelming. Academic libraries increasingly rely on third-party, cloudbased vendors to manage their systems and to provide access to their collections. When selecting library systems, library staff must understand privacy issues and be aware of how vendors use data. However, libraries do not always have the staffing, time or knowledge, and vendors are not always interested in upholding library values. The project examines the content of privacy policies for popular library systems used by Canadian academic libraries. The research aims to help librarians better understand the policies, to help them make informed decisions about their own library systems. The process used to code the privacy policies and the results of the coding are included alongside recommendations for vendors and library employees. Building on two seminal privacy studies, the methodology is revised for a Canadian context and updated with today's terminology and context, making it adaptable for other libraries and context around the world.},

However, algorithms are trained disproportionately on White faces, and thus White AI faces may appear especially realistic. In Experiment 1 ( N = 124 adults), alongside our reanalysis of previously published data, we showed that White AI faces are judged as human more often than actual human faces---a phenomenon we term AI hyperrealism. Paradoxically, people who made the most errors in this task were the most confident (a Dunning-Kruger effect). In Experiment 2 ( N = 610 adults), we used face-space theory and participant qualitative reports to identify key facial attributes that distinguish AI from human faces but were misinterpreted by participants, leading to AI hyperrealism. However, the attributes permitted high accuracy using machine learning. These findings illustrate how psychological theory can inform understanding of AI outputs and provide direction for debiasing AI algorithms, thereby promoting the ethical use of AI.},

In this work, we draw attention to the highly critical yet overlooked notion of contextual privacy by proposing ConfAIde, a benchmark designed to identify critical weaknesses in the privacy reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our experiments show that even the most capable models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT reveal private information in contexts that humans would not, 39\% and 57\% of the time, respectively. This leakage persists even when we employ privacy-inducing prompts or chain-of-thought reasoning. Our work underscores the immediate need to explore novel inference-time privacy-preserving approaches, based on reasoning and theory of mind.},

However, GenAI also raises significant privacy and security concerns, as models and privacy-sensitive user data, such as student records, may be misused by service providers. Unfortunately, end-users often have little awareness of or control over how these models operate. To address these concerns, universities are developing institutional policies to guide GenAI use while safeguarding security and privacy. This work examines these emerging policies and guidelines, with a particular focus on the often-overlooked privacy and security dimensions of GenAI integration in higher education, alongside other academic values. Through a qualitative analysis of GenAI usage guidelines from universities across 12 countries, we identify key challenges and opportunities institutions face in providing effective privacy and security protections, including the need for GenAI safeguards tailored specifically to the academic context.},

This article traces this quiet expansion by using an innovative virtual private network (VPN)-based method and by calling for an analytical focus on the landscape of the digital civil society in Africa. Specifically, I outline two key, interrelated phenomena: (1) Facebook?s evolving strategy, including a greater engagement with civil society organizations and (2) the focus of digital rights activists in Africa on issues like Internet shutdowns, government surveillance, and the lack of data privacy frameworks. In the process, I illuminate broader trends in the digital industry including tech corporations? growing investments in mobile social media, network infrastructures, and in civil society; the use of disadvantaged populations and unregulated territories for digital experiments and data extraction; and the mounting recognition of Facebook?s political role, both within and outside the corporation.},

  abstract = {Variation in patient outcomes among institutions and within institutions is a major problem in healthcare. Some of this variation is due to differences in practice, termed practice variation. Some practice variation is expected due to appropriately personalized care for a given patient. However, some practice variation is due to the individual preference or style of the clinicians. Quality improvement collaboratives are commonly used to disseminate quality care on a wide scale. Practice variation is a notable barrier to any quality improvement effort. A detailed and accurate understanding of practice variation can help optimize the quality improvement efforts. The traditional survey methods do not capture the complex nuances of practice variation. Vignette methods have been shown to accurately measure the actual practice variation and quality of care delivered by clinicians. Vignette methods are cost-effective relative to other methods of measuring quality of care. This review describes our experience and lessons from implementing vignette research methods in quality improvement collaboratives in California neonatal intensive care units. Vignette methodology is an ideal tool to address practice variation in quality improvement collaboratives, actively engage a large number of participants, and support more evidence-based practice to improve outcomes.},

In particular, we investigate two types of attacks -- goal hijacking and prompt leaking -- and demonstrate that even low-aptitude, but sufficiently ill-intentioned agents, can easily exploit GPT-3's stochastic nature, creating long-tail risks.

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is forcing a dramatic transformation of the methods by which we acquire knowledge and engage in collaborative learning. Although there are several studies on how AI can support collaborative learning, there are no published studies examining how students can actually collaborate among themselves while interacting with AI tools. For this study, thirty postgraduate students were organized into teams of three, and each team developed a project mainly exploiting responses from ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and MS Copilot, as well as the internet and class resources. Each team selected a specific internet of things (IoT) application area and described the technologies and real-world cases in this area. Then, each team delivered a report with the full description of their project and their interactions with these generative AI (GenAI) tools and presented their work in class. Additionally, students answered an online questionnaire with closed- and open-ended questions and participated in focus group discussions. Members of each team collaborated to design prompts using five suggested modes of collaboration. Eventually, half of the students exploited all five collaborative modes, but they mostly liked and preferred three of these collaborative modes. On average, teammates initially disagreed 24\% of the time but eventually reached an agreement. Students appreciated GenAI tools for their quick and well-structured responses, natural communication style, broad subject coverage, as well as their ability to simplify complex topics and support personalized learning. However, they expressed concerns about GenAI tools' inaccurate and inconsistent responses and identified key risks, such as passive learning, over-dependence, outdated information, and privacy issues. Finally, students recommended that GenAI tools should provide a shared and well-organized discussion space for collaborative prompt asking, allowing all team members to simultaneously view each other's prompts and the tool's responses. They also advised source verification and proper training to ensure these tools remain supplementary rather than primary learning resources.},

  abstract = {Whilst learning analytics is still nascent in most African higher education institutions, many African higher education institutions use learning platforms and analytic services from providers outside of the African continent. A critical consideration of the protection of data privacy on the African continent and its implications for learning analytics in African higher education is therefore needed. In this paper, we map the current state of legal and regulatory environments and frameworks on privacy to establish their implications for learning analytics. This scoping review of privacy regulations in 32 African countries, complemented by 15 scholarly papers, revealed that there are numerous national and regional legislation and regulatory frameworks, providing clear pointers pertaining to (student) data privacy to governments, higher education institutions and researchers. As such, the findings of this research have implications for African higher education to ensure not only legal compliance but also to oversee and safeguard student data privacy as part of their fiduciary duty. This research provides crucial insights regarding the importance of context for thinking about the expansion and institutional adoption of learning analytics. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Personal data have become commodified and are regarded as a valuable commercial asset. The commercial value of data relies on the collection and analysis of increasing volumes, granularity, variety and velocity of personal data (both identifiable and aggregated). Africa and African higher education are regarded as new data frontiers to be exploited. What this paper adds This paper, for the first time, makes an attempt to map privacy legislation and academic research on (student) data privacy in the African continent. Maps key implications for African higher educations to consider in collecting, analysing, using and sharing student data. It provides pointers for a research agenda pertaining to student data privacy on the African continent. Implications for practice and/or policy African higher education institutions should consider student data privacy when entering into service level agreements with educational technology and platform providers. African governments should develop common data sharing frameworks to facilitate cross-border data transfer. Current African data privacy legislation provides important implications for the adoption and institutionalisation of learning analytics. African higher education also has to consider the ethical aspects of learning analytics.},

It builds on a unique dataset of privacy definitions collected from a representative sample of 608 US social media users. The data are analyzed using topic modeling and semantic network analysis to unpack the multidimensionality of social media privacy. These dimensions are further examined in relation to established demographic antecedents of privacy concerns and behaviors. Results indicate the dominance of frames related to horizontal dimensions of privacy, or privacy vis-\`a-vis peers, as compared with the vertical dimensions, or privacy vis-\`a-vis institutions. In addition, the findings suggest that user conceptualization of privacy reflects a cognate-based approach that emphasizes control and limits to information access. Implications for privacy research, policy, and technology design are discussed.},

  abstract = {Third-party services form an integral part of the mobile ecosystem: they ease application development and enable features such as analytics, social network integration, and app monetization through ads. However, aided by the general opacity of mobile systems, such services are also largely invisible to users. This has negative consequences for user privacy as third-party services can potentially track users without their consent, even across multiple applications. Using real-world mobile traffic data gathered by the Lumen Privacy Monitor (Lumen), a privacyenhancing app with the ability to analyze network traffic on mobile devices in user space, we present insights into the mobile advertising and tracking ecosystem and its stakeholders. In this study, we develop automated methods to detect third-party advertising and tracking services at the traffic level. Using this technique we identify 2,121 such services, of which 233 were previously unknown to other popular advertising and tracking blacklists. We then uncover the business relationships between the providers of these services and characterize them by their prevalence in the mobile and Web ecosystem. Our analysis of the privacy policies of the largest advertising and tracking service providers shows that sharing harvested data with subsidiaries and third-party affiliates is the norm. Finally, we seek to identify the services likely to be most impacted by privacy regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ePrivacy directives.},

The increasing sophistication of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), which can produce outputs indistinguishable from real content, thus carries the risk of being adopted by fraudsters to assist in the enactment of online scams.

Hegemonic AI can be thought of as a bio-necro-technopolitical machine that serves to maintain the capitalist, colonialist and patriarchal order of the world. To make this point, the proposed approach bridges the macro and micropolitical, building on Suely Rolnik?s call for understanding the effects of the macropolitical in the micropolitical, as well as what feminist black scholar Patricia Hill Collins made visible about oppressive systems operating at the structural, institutional and individual levels. A critical AI ethics is one that is concerned with the preservation of life and the coresponsibility of AI harms to the majority of the planet.},

Similar to its physical counterpart, GenAI content offers possibilities for content creation and accessibility while potentially contributing to digital pollution and ecosystem degradation. Drawing on multiliteracies theory and Conceptual Metaphor Theory, we argue that Critical Artificial Intelligence Literacy (CAIL) must be integrated into educational frameworks to help learners navigate this synthetic media landscape. We examine how GenAI can simultaneously lower the barriers to creative and academic production while threatening to degrade digital ecosystems through misinformation, bias, and algorithmic homogenization. The digital plastic metaphor provides a theoretical foundation for understanding both the affordances and challenges of GenAI, particularly in educational contexts, where issues of equity and access remain paramount. Our analysis concludes that cultivating CAIL through a multiliteracies lens is vital for ensuring the equitable development of critical competencies across geographical and cultural contexts, especially for those disproportionately vulnerable to GenAI's increasingly disruptive effects worldwide.},

This article analyses data as a form of capital that is distinct from, but has its roots in, economic capital. Data collection is driven by the perpetual cycle of capital accumulation, which in turn drives capital to construct and rely upon a universe in which everything is made of data. The imperative to capture all data, from all sources, by any means possible influences many key decisions about business models, political governance, and technological development. This article argues that many common practices of data accumulation should actually be understood in terms of data extraction, wherein data is taken with little regard for consent and compensation. By understanding data as a form capital, we can better analyse the meaning, practices, and implications of datafication as a political economic regime.},

Future research should invest in an ``AI for people'', going beyond the undoubtedly much-needed efforts into ethics, explainability and responsible AI. The article addresses this challenge by problematizing the discussion around AI shifting the attention to individuals and their awareness, knowledge and emotional response to AI. First, we outline our main argument relative to the need for a socio-technical perspective in the study of AI social implications. Then, we illustrate the main existing narratives of hopes and fears associated with AI and robots. As building blocks of broader ``sociotechnical imaginaries'', narratives are powerful tools that shape how society sees, interprets and organizes technology. An original empirical study within the University of Bologna collects the data to examine the levels of awareness, knowledge and emotional response towards AI, revealing interesting insights to be carried on in future research. Replete with exaggerations, both utopian and dystopian narratives are analysed with respect to some relevant socio-demographic variables (gender, generation and competence). Finally, focusing on two issues---the state of AI anxiety and the point of view of non-experts---opens the floor to problematizing the discourse around AI, sustaining the need for a sociological perspective in the field of AI and discussing future comparative research.},

Despite its wide-spread deployment and its potential impact on bridging the digital divide, to date, few studies have rigorously measured the quality of the free Internet service offered by Free Basics. In this short paper, we characterize the quality of the Free Basics service offered in Pakistan and South Africa along three dimensions: (i) the selection of accessible Web services, (ii) the functionality of those services, and (iii) the network performance for those services. While preliminary, our findings show that datadriven studies are essential for having more informed public debates on the pros and cons of the current design of the Free Basics service.},

This paper provides an overview of the current literature. Within the frontier AI's crucial application in developing defense mechanisms for detecting deepfakes, we highlight the mechanisms through which generative AI based on large models (LM-based GenAI) craft seemingly convincing yet fabricated contents. We explore the multifaceted implications of LM-based GenAI on society, politics, and individual privacy violations, underscoring the urgent need for robust defense strategies. To address these challenges, in this study, we introduce an integrated framework that combines advanced detection algorithms, cross-platform collaboration, and policy-driven initiatives to mitigate the risks associated with AI-Generated Content (AIGC). By leveraging multi-modal analysis, digital watermarking, and machine learning-based authentication techniques, we propose a defense mechanism adaptable to AI capabilities of ever-evolving nature. Furthermore, the paper advocates for a global consensus on the ethical usage of GenAI and implementing cyber-wellness educational programs to enhance public awareness and resilience against m/disinformation. Our findings suggest that a proactive and collaborative approach involving technological innovation and regulatory oversight is essential for safeguarding netizens while interacting with cyberspace against the insidious effects of deepfakes and GenAI-enabled m/disinformation campaigns.},

At the time of data collection, these institutions were in the early stages of GenAI adoption. A survey of 160 students revealed varied uses of GenAI and suggested that a notable proportion of students perceived the guidelines, and their delivery as unclear or inconsistent. Our results indicate that GenAI usage is not yet fully addressed in course-level practices, which may contribute to fragmented and inconsistent use of the technology among students. Moreover, students were more likely to seek help from peers than from educators when encountering difficulties with AI applications, which may reflect students' perceptions of the limited availability of educator support. The findings support previous research that there is a need for increased awareness of GenAI use in higher education among both students and educators. The study highlights the need for strengthening the role of educators in encouraging and influencing how their students perceive and adopt GenAI technology.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has expanded significantly in recent years, permeating various sectors of the economy and the daily lives of over 5.5 billion active internet users worldwide. However, this rapid adoption necessitates an analysis of the trade-offs inherent to its operation, many of which remain largely unknown to the public. Drawing on data from academic articles, technical reports, data repositories, and government documents, this article examines the physical, energy, and geopolitical dimensions underpinning AI. Although often perceived as immaterial, AI depends on a vast and complex physical infrastructure, sustained by data centers that house thousands of devices composed of a diverse array of minerals and metals, many classified as critical. Currently, approximately 12,000 data centers are in operation globally, including 992 hyperscale facilities spanning thousands of square meters. The short lifecycle of equipment in these centers, combined with inadequate disposal practices, leads to the loss of valuable metals from the supply chain, further intensifying mineral extraction and exacerbating socio-environmental impacts. Simultaneously, the rivalry between the United States and China over control of critical minerals and dominance in AI technologies has escalated geopolitical tensions, resulting in mutual restrictions on the export of advanced technologies and essential minerals. Another critical factor is AI's substantial energy consumption: in the United States, data centers already account for approximately 4\% of national electricity consumption, with projections reaching 9.1\% by 2030. While major technology companies invest in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind to meet this growing demand, these sources also require significant volumes of critical minerals. These interrelated factors underscore the intricate connections between Artificial Intelligence, Data Centers, Critical Minerals, Energy, and Geopolitics.},

This study analyzes land use in 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021, and 2025 using an artificial neural network cellular automata (ANN-CA) and rice data from Statistics Indonesia to predict future rice status in Malang Districts, Indonesia. The primary LULC change driver was the rapid conversion of rice fields, which had their area reduced by 18\% from 2019 to 2021 and 2\% from 2021 to 2025. Rice fields are mainly being converted to settlements and buildings. The Kappa coefficient of simulation achieved 88\%, with 91 accuracies. The model predicted a 2\% lower rate of rice production but a 3\% higher demand in 2025 compared to 2021. Lower rice production and higher demand are predicted to reduce the rice surplus by 57\% in 2025, suggesting that the Malang district might lower its supply of rice to other areas by 2025. Our study provides a food crisis early warning system that decision makers can use to form adequate strategic plans and solutions to combat food insecurity.},

Data can also be stolen or destroyed, by criminals, foreign powers and terrorists. While countries have enthusiastically created telecommunications regulatory authorities, they have only rarely created data protection authorities to oversee well established principles for the collection, use and storage of data. Similarly, they have lagged on the introduction of strategies for cybersecurity and the centres needed to collect data on attacks and defences. Surveillance by secret police has grown in sophistication, with facilities for lawful interception, IMSIcatchers and surveillance RATs, none of which is overseen by parliaments or the courts. Consequently, the rights to dignity and privacy are very poorly observed and more often breached.},

While broad-level, institutional guidelines provide value in understanding the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence (AI) for the classroom, there is a need for a more ecological understanding of how AI ethics might be constructed locally, one that takes into account the negotiation of AI between teacher and student. This article investigates how an educational ethical framework for AI use emerges through a qualitative case study of one composition student's interaction with and understanding of using ChatGPT as a type of writing partner. Analysis of interview data and student logs uncover what we term an emergent ``local ethic'' -- a framework that is capable of exploring unique ethical considerations, values, and norms that develop at the most foundational unit of higher education -- the individual classroom. Our framework is meant to provide a heuristic for other writing teacher-scholars as they interrogate issues related to pedagogy, student criticality, agency, reliability, and access within the context of powerful AI systems.},

I explore two aspects of this by drawing two comparisons with other forms of potential: ova and genes. First, building on ethnographic fieldwork with environmental scientists and technicians in the Brazilian Amazon, I compare data processing with ova donation in the United Kingdom in order to explore how data processing might be considered a form of reproductive labour. I then turn to emergent big data infrastructures in the environmental sciences, and compare the environmental sciences with genomics, in order to gesture towards some critical questions that need to be asked of such open data initiatives. I end with a reflection on comparison as a privileged means of drawing out the forms understood to be latent within data.},

  abstract = {The advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can provide opportunities for enriching educational experiences, but at the same time raise concerns regarding academic integrity. Many educators have expressed anxiety and hesitation when it comes to integrating GenAI in their teaching practices. Thus, recommendations and guidance from institutions are needed to support instructors in this new and emerging GenAI era. In response to this need, this study explores different U.S. universities' academic policies and guidelines regarding the use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching and learning, and from there, gains understanding of how these universities respond and adapt to the development of GenAI in their academic contexts. Data sources include academic policies, statements, guidelines, and relevant resources provided by the top 100 universities in the U.S. Results show that the majority of these universities adopt an open but cautious approach towards GenAI. Primary concerns lie in ethical usage, accuracy, and data privacy. Most universities actively respond and provide diverse types of resources, such as syllabus templates, workshops, shared articles, and one-on-one consultations; focusing on a range of topics, namely general technical introduction, ethical concerns, pedagogical applications, preventive strategies, data privacy, limitations, and detective tools. The findings provide four practical pedagogical implications for educators when considering GenAI in teaching practices: 1) accepting GenAI presence, 2) aligning GenAI use with learning objectives, 3) evolving curriculum to prevent misuse of GenAI, and 4) adopting multifaceted evaluation strategies. For recommendations toward policy making, the article suggests two possible directions for the use of GenAI tools: 1) establishing discipline-specific policies and guidelines, and 2) managing students' sensitive information in a transparent and careful manner.},

These data are viewed as highly valuable for online advertisers, but their usage faces increasing headwinds. In this paper, we quantify the benefit to advertisers from using such offsite tracking data in their ad delivery. With this goal in mind, we conduct a large-scale, randomized experiment that includes more than 70,000 advertisers on Facebook and Instagram. We first estimate advertising effectiveness at baseline across our broad sample. We then estimate the change in effectiveness of the same campaigns were advertisers to lose the ability to optimize ad delivery with offsite data. In each of these cases, we use recently developed deconvolution techniques to flexibly estimate the underlying distribution of effects. We find a median cost per incremental customer at baseline of \$38.16 that under the median loss in effectiveness would rise to \$49.93, a 31\% increase. Further, we find ads targeted using offsite data generate more long-term customers per dollar than those without, and losing offsite data disproportionately hurts small scale advertisers. Taken together, our results suggest that offsite data bring large benefits to a wide range of advertisers. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor for this article.

This can be looking for a recipe, getting help on an essay, or looking for relationship advice. Yet, there is limited understanding of how individuals perceive advice provided by these LLMs. In this paper, we explore people's perception of LLM-generated advice, and what role diverse user characteristics (i.e., personality and technology readiness) play in shaping their perception. Further, as LLM-generated advice can be difficult to distinguish from human advice, we assess the perceived creepiness of such advice. To investigate this, we run an exploratory study (N~=~91), where participants rate advice in different styles (generated by GPT-3.5 Turbo). Notably, our findings suggest that individuals who identify as more agreeable tend to like the advice more and find it more useful. Further, individuals with higher technological insecurity are more likely to follow and find the advice more useful, and deem it more likely that a friend could have given the advice. Lastly, we see that advice given in a `skeptical' style was rated most unpredictable, and advice given in a `whimsical' style was rated least malicious---indicating that LLM advice styles influence user perceptions. Our results also provide an overview of people's considerations on likelihood, receptiveness, and what advice they are likely to seek from these digital assistants. Based on our results, we provide design takeaways for LLM-generated advice and outline future research directions to further inform the design of LLM-generated advice for support applications targeting people with diverse expectations and needs.},

The objective of the project is to encourage the use of institutionally endorsed solutions for research data management. Based on interviews conducted by a team of librarians in a small, social science research centre, preliminary results indicate that attitude is the key element which will need to be addressed in designing intervention strategies to modify behaviour. The paper concludes with a discussion of the next stages in the project, which involve further data collection and analysis, the implementation of targeted strategies, and a follow-up activity to assess the extent of modifications to current undesirable practices.},

While existing problems have distinctive features, the underlying causes, which stem from the structure of the world-system, are not novel to this or the previous century. We assert that it is useful to distinguish between three tiers of time in order to recognize the various forces, systems, and processes that operate within the world. The global capitalist system, which operates on the second tier, acts as a form of "social gravity" that is pervasive and constant. Too often, it goes unnoticed or is simply assumed to be immutable. As a result, mainstream thinkers focus on the particularities of environmental problems and offer "solutions" (such as energy efficiency, new sources of energy, and other technological fixes) that fail to address or solve the original problems. Often attempts to solve one problem generate new problems, given specific shifts in the capitalist system and its technical regimes. To overcome modern environmental crises will require addressing the root causes of them: the contradictions inherent in the capitalist system.},

This article provides a theoretical analysis of the complex interconnectedness among these systems guided by the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT). Building on the analysis, we introduce CoPL, a multi-agent system consisting of multiple agents with distinct functions that facilitate the complex PL design and engage pre-service teachers (PSTs) in dynamic conversations while prompting them to reflect on the inclusivity of agent-generated instructional suggestions. We describe the affordances and limitations of the system as a professional learning tool for PSTs to develop competencies for designing inclusive PL to meet diverse learning needs of all learners. Finally, we discuss future research on refining CoPL and its practical applications.},

Participants receive advice from a GPT model and can update their initial responses. The advisor's identity ("AI chatbot" versus a human "expert"), presence of a written justification, and advice correctness do not significantly affect weight on advice. Instead, participants weigh advice more heavily if they (1) are unfamiliar with the topic, (2) used ChatGPT in the past, or (3) received more accurate advice previously. The last two effects -- algorithm familiarity and experience -- are stronger with an AI chatbot as the advisor. Participants that receive written justifications are able to discern correct advice and update accordingly. Student participants are miscalibrated in their judgements of ChatGPT advice accuracy; one reason is that they significantly misjudge the accuracy of ChatGPT on 11/25 topics. Participants under-weigh advice by over 50\% and can score better by trusting ChatGPT more.},
